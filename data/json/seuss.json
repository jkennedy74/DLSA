{"column1":"Now please dont ask why No one quite knows the reason"}
{"column1":"It could be his head wasnt screwed on just right"}
{"column1":"It could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight"}

{"column1":"He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos"}
{"column1":"Staring down from his cave with a sour Grinchy frown"}
{"column1":"At the warm lighted windows below in their town"}
{"column1":"For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath"}
{"column1":"Was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath"}

{"column1":"Tomorrow is Christmas Its practically here"}
{"column1":"Then he growled with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming"}
{"column1":"I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming"}
{"column1":"For Tomorrow he knew all the Who girls and boys"}
{"column1":"Would wake bright and early Theyd rush for their toys"}
{"column1":"And then Oh the noise Oh the Noise"}
{"column1":"Noise Noise Noise"}

{"column1":"They would feast on Who pudding and rare Who roast beast"}
{"column1":"Which was something the Grinch couldnt stand in the least"}
{"column1":"And THEN Theyd do something He liked least of all"}
{"column1":"Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small"}
{"column1":"Would stand close together with Christmas bells ringing"}
{"column1":"Theyd stand hand in hand And the Whos would start singing"}
{"column1":"Theyd sing And theyd sing And theyd SING"}
{"column1":"SING SING SING"}
{"column1":"And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing"}
{"column1":"The more the Grinch thought I must stop this whole thing"}
{"column1":"Why for fifty three years Ive put up with it now"}
{"column1":"I MUST stop this Christmas from coming But HOW"}
{"column1":"Then he got an idea An awful idea"}
{"column1":"THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL AWFUL IDEA"}
{"column1":"I know just what to do The Grinch laughed in his throat"}
{"column1":"And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat"}
{"column1":"And he chuckled and clucked What a great Grinchy trick"}
{"column1":"With this coat and this hat I look just like Saint Nick"}
{"column1":"All I need is a reindeer The Grinch looked around"}
{"column1":"But since reindeer are scarce there was none to be found"}
{"column1":"Did that stop the old Grinch No The Grinch simply said"}
{"column1":"If I cant find a reindeer Ill make one instead"}
{"column1":"So he called his dog Max Then he took some red thread"}
{"column1":"And he tied a big horn on the top of his head"}
{"column1":"THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks"}
{"column1":"On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max"}
{"column1":"Then the Grinch said Giddap And the sleigh started down"}
{"column1":"Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town"}
{"column1":"All their windows were dark Quiet snow filled the air"}
{"column1":"All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care"}
{"column1":"When he came to the first little house on the square"}
{"column1":"This is stop number one the old Grinchy Claus hissed"}
{"column1":"And he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist"}
{"column1":"Then he slid down the chimney A rather tight pinch"}
{"column1":"But if Santa could do it then so could the Grinch"}
{"column1":"He got stuck only once for a moment or two"}
{"column1":"Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue"}
{"column1":"Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row"}
{"column1":"These stockings he grinned are the first things to go"}
{"column1":"Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant"}
{"column1":"Around the whole room and he took every present"}
{"column1":"Pop guns And bicycles Roller skates Drums"}
{"column1":"Checkerboards Tricycles Popcorn And plums"}
{"column1":"And he stuffed them in bags Then the Grinch very nimbly"}
{"column1":"Stuffed all the bags one by one up the chimney"}
{"column1":"Then he slunk to the icebox He took the Whos feast"}
{"column1":"He took the Who pudding He took the roast beast"}
{"column1":"He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash"}
{"column1":"Why that Grinch even took their last can of Who hash"}
{"column1":"Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee"}
{"column1":"And NOW grinned the Grinch I will stuff up the tree"}
{"column1":"And the Grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove"}
{"column1":"When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove"}
{"column1":"He turned around fast and he saw a small Who"}
{"column1":"Little Cindy Lou Who who was not more than two"}
{"column1":"The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter"}
{"column1":"Whod got out of bed for a cup of cold water"}
{"column1":"She stared at the Grinch and said Santy Claus why�"}
{"column1":"Why are you taking our Christmas tree WHY"}
{"column1":"But you know that old Grinch was so smart and so slick"}
{"column1":"He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick"}
{"column1":"Why my sweet little tot the fake Santy Claus lied"}
{"column1":"Theres a light on this tree that wont light on one side"}
{"column1":"So Im taking it home to my workshop my dear"}
{"column1":"Ill fix it up there Then Ill bring it back here"}
{"column1":"And his fib fooled the child Then he patted her head"}
{"column1":"And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed"}
{"column1":"And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup"}
{"column1":"HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up"}
{"column1":"Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire"}
{"column1":"Then he went up the chimney himself the old liar"}
{"column1":"On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire"}
{"column1":"And the one speck of food That he left in the house"}
{"column1":"Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse"}
{"column1":"Then He did the same thing To the other Whos houses"}
{"column1":"Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos mouses"}
{"column1":"It was quarter past dawn All the Whos still a bed"}
{"column1":"All the Whos still asnooze When he packed up his sled"}
{"column1":"Packed it up with their presents The ribbons The wrappings"}
{"column1":"The tags And the tinsel The trimmings The trappings"}
{"column1":"Three thousand feet up Up the side of Mt Crumpit"}
{"column1":"He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it"}
{"column1":"PoohPooh to the Whos he was grinchishly humming"}
{"column1":"Theyre finding out now that no Christmas is coming"}
{"column1":"Theyre just waking up I know just what theyll do"}
{"column1":"Their mouths will hang open a minute or two"}
{"column1":"Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo"}
{"column1":"Thats a noise grinned the Grinch That I simply MUST hear"}
{"column1":"So he paused And the Grinch put his hand to his ear"}
{"column1":"And he did hear a sound rising over the snow"}
{"column1":"It started in low Then it started to grow"}
{"column1":"But the sound wasnt sad Why this sound sounded merry"}
{"column1":"It couldnt be so But it WAS merry VERY"}
{"column1":"He stared down at Whoville The Grinch popped his eyes"}
{"column1":"Then he shook What he saw was a shocking surprise"}
{"column1":"Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small"}
{"column1":"Was singing Without any presents at all"}
{"column1":"He HADNT stopped Christmas from coming IT CAME"}
{"column1":"Somehow or other it came just the same"}
{"column1":"And the Grinch with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow"}
{"column1":"Stood puzzling and puzzling: How could it be so"}
{"column1":"It came with out ribbons It came without tags"}
{"column1":"It came without packages boxes or bags"}
{"column1":"And he puzzled three hours till his puzzler was sore"}
{"column1":"Then the Grinch thought of something he hadnt before"}
{"column1":"Maybe Christmas he thought doesnt come from a store"}
{"column1":"Maybe Christmasperhapsmeans a little bit more"}
{"column1":"And what happened then Wellin Whoville they say"}
{"column1":"That the Grinchs small heart Grew three sizes that day"}
{"column1":"And the minute his heart didnt feel quite so tight"}
