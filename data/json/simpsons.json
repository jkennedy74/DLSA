{"column1":"by pumping high-pressure liquid into underground shale deposits fracking releases natural gas but can lead to devastating environmental consequences"}
{"column1":"yep used to be you could try burnin yer water all day and nothing would happen"}
{"column1":"henry did you remember to turn off the slip n slide"}
{"column1":"i reckon not"}

{"column1":"oh man he made us watch him dance for three hours and he really only has one move"}
{"column1":"if someone was fracking in our neighborhood wouldnt we know it"}
{"column1":"maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue"}
{"column1":"this is clearly a fracking site how are they keeping people away"}
{"column1":"its a terrific sport that--"}
{"column1":"shhh"}
{"column1":"this whole building is just a façade for a drilling operation"}
{"column1":"indeed it is evergreen terrace is built atop a massive shale deposit"}
{"column1":"think of it all that poor natural gas trapped underneath your shanties and lean-tos smithers give these two brats what they deserve for sticking their noses in my business"}
{"column1":"stopping mr burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on beezus and ramona but i know someone who can help"}

{"column1":"mr burns do you admit that you illegally pumped toxic chemicals into the groundwater below evergreen terrace"}
{"column1":"i dont recall"}
{"column1":"mr burns have you no regard for the life and health of your fellow human beings"}
{"column1":"i dont recall"}
{"column1":"you cant drill underneath peoples homes without their permission as chairwoman of this committee on energy natural resources and blimp safety your fracking operation is hereby shut down"}
{"column1":"i demand to see that capitalism-castrating suffragette this instant"}
{"column1":"you havent bested me i will find a way to shatter that shale"}
{"column1":"what makes men like you think you can do whatever you want to our planet"}

{"column1":"you dont know what the planet wants"}
{"column1":"oh and i suppose you do"}
{"column1":"the planet wants to be protected and nourished and maybe even"}

{"column1":"so monty should we find a way to continue this purely passionate affair"}
{"column1":"but youre a soft-hearted liberal"}
{"column1":"and youre a hard-hearted capitalist"}
{"column1":"now get out of my office"}
{"column1":"as soon as i collect my things"}
{"column1":"if i want to resume fracking"}
{"column1":"i have to buy the mineral rights for every single parcel of land in evergreen terrace to win people over ill need a salesman whose folksy façade masks a deep gusher of greed"}
{"column1":"congratulations simpson youre now my chief energy innovation marketing officer"}
{"column1":"woo-hoo"}
{"column1":"all youve got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors"}
{"column1":"woo-hoo i dont know fracking is one of those scary lisa words"}
{"column1":"bah fracking produces enough clean natural gas to make america independent of sheikhs caliphs and scandinavians not to mention it doesnt create any of that awful worker-mutating nuclear waste"}
{"column1":"homer game starts in an hour dont forget to set your fantasy lineup"}
{"column1":"thanks charlie maybe fracking isnt so bad"}
{"column1":"then say yes to this raise this promotion and this flannel shirt which says im not screwing you over"}
{"column1":"im not screwing you over no uh im not screwing you over im not screwing you over"}
{"column1":"im so proud of you poppa"}
{"column1":"some folks will tell you that frackings no good but what they dont tell you is hydraulic fracturing creates jobs"}
{"column1":"and all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what youre selling beer"}
{"column1":"authentic italian food"}
{"column1":"useless left-handed crap"}
{"column1":"magical nonsense"}
{"column1":"expensive toys for grownups they dont open or play with"}
{"column1":"pornography and nachos"}
{"column1":"high-quality spanish language programming"}
{"column1":"high-quality methamphetamines"}
{"column1":"laundry homework pranks poop poop and poop"}
{"column1":"but our water was on fire"}
{"column1":"how could you sell fracking for mr burns"}
{"column1":"because ive never gotten a promotion before once i thought i had but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing so judge me all you want"}
{"column1":"i am judging you"}
{"column1":"good judge away"}
{"column1":"judge-judge-judge--"}
{"column1":"pumping frack cash its a gas cash blast"}
{"column1":"residents of evergreen terrace are undecided whether to sell their mineral rights to mr burns"}
{"column1":"mr burns is a vampire sucking the life blood of this town and lining his coffin with cash"}
{"column1":"oh maxine no one insults me in a sound bite the way you do"}
{"column1":"oh monty youre such a sexy little nosferatu"}
{"column1":"same time tomorrow night ill bring the oxygen"}
{"column1":"better bring two tanks"}
{"column1":"and so we see a clear correlation between industrial hydro-compounds and water table contamination well outside the margin of error"}
{"column1":"mr simpson rebuttal"}
{"column1":"everyone who signs over their mineral rights to mr burns gets five thousand dollars"}
{"column1":"five thousand smackers"}
{"column1":"money is like a job you dont even have to do"}
{"column1":"aye dinero"}
{"column1":"signing stu"}
{"column1":"i think my arguments were more cogent"}
{"column1":"what"}
{"column1":"cogent"}
{"column1":"mr burns we did it everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights"}
{"column1":"excellent"}
{"column1":"well one"}
{"column1":"i have embarked on a beneficial friendship with a woman with whom i have nothing in common her opinions are abhorrent to me but the passion well look at these racy texts she sends me"}
{"column1":"oh baby"}
{"column1":"well im no carl when it comes to this stuff but i aint no lenny neither and i would say no matter how much you try to keep things casual someone always gets hurt"}
{"column1":"hmm well then i must harden my heart against such an outcome"}
{"column1":"glad i could be of help"}
{"column1":"do you have the signed gas leases"}
{"column1":"hold on this feels light one of these deeds is missing a signature"}
{"column1":"the gas rights transfer form for 742 evergreen terrace was never signed by marge simpson"}
{"column1":"marge why didnt you sign"}
{"column1":"our water was on fire"}
{"column1":"im sorry but the law states that unless every single resident sells their rights burns cant frack drop one"}
{"column1":"i was counting on that money to pay for my other calf implant"}
{"column1":"i already felt the pride of energy independence"}
{"column1":"marge simpson im as mad at you as you usually are at me"}
{"column1":"cheer up monty all you lost was money but what you get is me"}
{"column1":"all i lost was money let me make one thing perfectly clear -- our dalliance meant nothing to me you were but a sprig of parsley garnishing my beefsteak and now i cast you aside for the busboys to gnaw upon consider this ill-conceived affair terminated"}
{"column1":"i played this just perfectly"}
{"column1":"oh yeah great great marge great work thanks to you springfield will never be a natural gas boom town and like all boom towns it would have lasted forever"}

{"column1":"blackjacks for suckers my brother he used to own three arbys franchises -- lost em all at the tables and gave himself a shotgun tonsillectomy"}
{"column1":"what i told you was to wait in the car"}
{"column1":"the mumbai institute of tantric sex where i was recruited by a card-counting ring"}
{"column1":"am i hearing this right is the church council truly considering gambling"}
{"column1":"you know ned the bible never explicitly condemns gambling biblical folks were always playing games of chance like uh drawing lots"}
{"column1":"card counting is not gambling it is math"}
{"column1":"and its not even against the rules"}
{"column1":"dad mom trusted us with a secret--"}
{"column1":"exactly if you are caught you cannot be charged with any crime the worst they will do is beat you with a phone book or break some fingers but what is a little pain if your church is to be saved"}
{"column1":"it is all good"}
{"column1":"counting cards requires absolute focus you must ignore all casino distractions"}
{"column1":"and beware of cocktail waitresses with free drinks and eyeball-height cleavage theyre not attractive but you cannot look away"}
{"column1":"freshen your drink hon who had the scotch and soda cocktails cocktails another one hon"}
{"column1":"you -- what is the count"}
{"column1":"get your head in the game mel"}
{"column1":"remember for this legal but-frowned-upon scheme to work we must have complete secrecy do not tell anyone what you are doing"}
{"column1":"not even homer"}
{"column1":"homer is many things but not a good accomplice if he gets involved and this scheme fails what happens to our church"}
{"column1":"even i saw that i guess i cant tell homer"}
{"column1":"well to raise money were putting on a revue"}
{"column1":"yeah so uh im going out to rehearse the revue"}
{"column1":"go go make magic you just go"}
{"column1":"revue"}
{"column1":"card counting is simple"}
{"column1":"you all sit at different tables betting low playing hand after hand counting in your head how many high cards are left in the deck"}
{"column1":"ignore all distractions"}
{"column1":"when the count is high you have a hot deck and the odds are in your favor then you use a secret signal to call in the closer"}
{"column1":"the closer bets big wins bigger and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally-acceptable screw job"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"but use caution there are eyes everywhere sooner or later the casino will catch on"}
{"column1":"what a haul"}
{"column1":"i think we can do something a little harder than that"}
{"column1":"mmm now thats a marshmallow-y smore-garita"}
{"column1":"oh boy oh boy"}
{"column1":"one am lovin and two am steak night marriage rules i guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue"}

{"column1":"where has this been all my life"}

{"column1":"uh one second belladonna helen and i have found that uh these new personas have been quite liberating"}
{"column1":"was that a womans voice send her in"}
{"column1":"if we dont give back the money we won counting cards the casino people are going to hurt homer"}
{"column1":"are you gonna put my head in a vise"}
{"column1":"we dont do that we dont even have a vise"}

{"column1":"i dont know if you watch us all the time or if were just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels weve built"}
{"column1":"maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe and im going to sit here and focus on that good and maybe just maybe ill get my husband back"}

{"column1":"mr and mrs simpson are here"}
{"column1":"send them in"}

{"column1":"oh no he cant mean that"}
{"column1":"my wife thinks you want me to pay for it"}
{"column1":"that was the idea"}
{"column1":"oh"}
{"column1":"by itself something like this might not call for an extreme penaltybut this is not an isolated incident barts behavior is unruly hes frequently absent from school then gives teachers pathetic excuse notesthat are obviously childish forgeries when compared to"}
{"column1":"well at any rate it is my reluctant decision --"}

{"column1":"uh-huh do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis"}
{"column1":"wow its like youre readin my mind man"}
{"column1":"a-ha you see when a child with barts intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person hes probably going to lash out in ways like these"}
{"column1":"i think we should re-test him"}
{"column1":"no no i think we should move him to another school"}
{"column1":"oh better yet"}
{"column1":"bart wed like you to try a kind of school that doesnt rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers a school without walls where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to does that sound good bart"}

{"column1":"from his humble beginnings as a street mime in tupelo mississippi"}
{"column1":"krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire --"}
{"column1":"-- with dozens of endorsements including his own line of pork products this may have led to one of televisions best-loved bloopers -- krustys near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986"}

{"column1":"this new krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in todays anything-for-a- thrill youth"}
{"column1":"give a hoot read a book"}
{"column1":"krustys arrest has sent shock waves through springfield packing its churches synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizenry from all walks of life"}

{"column1":"its called the raven"}
{"column1":"once upon a midnight dreary"}
{"column1":"while i pondered weak and weary"}
{"column1":"over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping"}
{"column1":"huh"}
{"column1":"like what"}
{"column1":"as of someone gently rapping rapping at my chamber door"}
{"column1":"tis some visitor"}
{"column1":"i muttered"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"are we scared yet"}
{"column1":"bart hes establishing mood"}
{"column1":"ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow -- vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow"}
{"column1":"-- sorrow for the lost lenore --"}
{"column1":"oh lenore"}
{"column1":"for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore -- nameless here for evermore"}
{"column1":"aag"}
{"column1":"and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating"}
{"column1":"tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- this it is and nothing more"}
{"column1":"presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer"}
{"column1":"sir --"}
{"column1":"-- said i --"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"here i opened wide the door --"}
{"column1":"this better be good"}
{"column1":"darkness there and nothing more"}
{"column1":"you know what would have been scarier than nothing"}
{"column1":"what"}
{"column1":"anything"}
{"column1":"back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before"}
{"column1":"surely --"}
{"column1":"-- said i --"}
{"column1":"-- surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore --"}
{"column1":"mr burns in twenty years i have never seen such a shoddy deplorable --"}
{"column1":"open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door -- perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door -- perched and sat and nothing more"}
{"column1":"though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou --"}
{"column1":"i said --"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"quoth the raven"}
{"column1":"eat my shorts"}
{"column1":"bart stop it he says nevermore thats all hell ever say"}
{"column1":"okay okay"}
{"column1":"then methought the air grew denser perfumed by some unseen censer"}
{"column1":"ouch censer"}
{"column1":"swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor"}
{"column1":"wretch --"}
{"column1":"i cried --"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"quoth the raven"}
{"column1":"nevermore"}
{"column1":"be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend"}
{"column1":"i shrieked of starting"}
{"column1":"get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore oh leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken -- quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door"}
{"column1":"quoth the raven"}
{"column1":"nevermore"}
{"column1":"take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door"}
{"column1":"quoth the raven"}
{"column1":"nevermore"}
{"column1":"why you little --"}
{"column1":"uh-oh"}
{"column1":"come back here now raven"}
{"column1":"nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore"}
{"column1":"and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted -- nevermore"}
{"column1":"lisa that wasnt scary not even for a poem"}

{"column1":"hello mr burns"}
{"column1":"oh hello charles be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection"}
{"column1":"glad to mr burns you see every so often mother nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth sharper claws longer legs or in this case a third eye and if these variations turn out to be an improvement the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the face of the earth"}
{"column1":"so youre saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish it may in fact be a kind of super fish"}
{"column1":"i wouldnt mind having a third eye would you"}
{"column1":"no you see friends if our anti-nuclear naysayers and choose-up-siders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant theyd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman"}
{"column1":"the truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that cant be beat mmmm mmmm so to summarize say what you want about me i can take the slings and arrows but stop slandering poor defenseless blinky good night and god bless"}

{"column1":"have you found any dirt on mary bailey"}
{"column1":"well weve gone through her garbage"}

{"column1":"no ive tried it before"}
{"column1":"mrs simpson what is your opinion of dr riviera and let me remind you that youre under oath"}

{"column1":"and mrs simpson could you describe for us in your own words barts intense mental anguish and suffering"}
