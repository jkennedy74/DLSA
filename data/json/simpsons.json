{"column1":"dont worry bart you wont learn anything"}
{"column1":"its called the raven"}
{"column1":"once upon a midnight dreary"}
{"column1":"while i pondered weak and weary"}
{"column1":"over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping"}
{"column1":"huh"}
{"column1":"like what"}
{"column1":"as of someone gently rapping rapping at my chamber door"}
{"column1":"tis some visitor"}
{"column1":"i muttered"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"are we scared yet"}
{"column1":"bart hes establishing mood"}
{"column1":"ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow -- vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow"}
{"column1":"-- sorrow for the lost lenore --"}
{"column1":"oh lenore"}
{"column1":"for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore -- nameless here for evermore"}
{"column1":"aag"}
{"column1":"and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating"}
{"column1":"tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- this it is and nothing more"}
{"column1":"presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer"}
{"column1":"sir --"}
{"column1":"-- said i --"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"here i opened wide the door --"}
{"column1":"this better be good"}
{"column1":"darkness there and nothing more"}
{"column1":"you know what would have been scarier than nothing"}
{"column1":"what"}
{"column1":"anything"}
{"column1":"back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before"}
{"column1":"surely --"}
{"column1":"-- said i --"}
{"column1":"-- surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore --"}
{"column1":"mr burns in twenty years i have never seen such a shoddy deplorable --"}
{"column1":"open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door -- perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door -- perched and sat and nothing more"}
{"column1":"though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou --"}
{"column1":"i said --"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"quoth the raven"}
{"column1":"eat my shorts"}
{"column1":"bart stop it he says nevermore thats all hell ever say"}
{"column1":"okay okay"}
{"column1":"then methought the air grew denser perfumed by some unseen censer"}
{"column1":"ouch censer"}
{"column1":"swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor"}
{"column1":"wretch --"}
{"column1":"i cried --"}
{"column1":"#NAME?"}
{"column1":"quoth the raven"}
{"column1":"nevermore"}
{"column1":"be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend"}
{"column1":"i shrieked of starting"}
{"column1":"get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore oh leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken -- quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door"}
{"column1":"quoth the raven"}
{"column1":"nevermore"}
{"column1":"take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door"}
{"column1":"quoth the raven"}
{"column1":"nevermore"}
{"column1":"why you little --"}
{"column1":"uh-oh"}
{"column1":"come back here now raven"}
{"column1":"nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore"}
{"column1":"and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted -- nevermore"}
{"column1":"lisa that wasnt scary not even for a poem"}
{"column1":"well it was written in 1845 maybe people were easier to scare back then"}

{"column1":"no ive tried it before"}
{"column1":"mrs simpson what is your opinion of dr riviera and let me remind you that youre under oath"}
{"column1":"well to be honest he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better and he mispronounced words that even i know like abdomen and his office was dirty now that i think about it im not sure hes even a doctor"}
{"column1":"and mrs simpson could you describe for us in your own words barts intense mental anguish and suffering"}
{"column1":"well i dont know how intense it was"}
{"column1":"huh uh"}
{"column1":"but well i guess he did miss three days of school --"}
{"column1":"oh three days"}
{"column1":"although he doesnt really like school all that much"}

{"column1":"no it doesnt"}
{"column1":"it was a little hard on me having him around the house"}

{"column1":"all that time"}
{"column1":"could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships"}
