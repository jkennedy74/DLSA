their skipping lessons are really payin off
hello hello im-im marge simpson and im here to talk about a-a-a wonderful beautiful thing--
speaking of beautiful things tongue me babe
how many of you are here for the free cookies because weve discontinued that
one of our brightest and most meddlesome students called this meeting somehow to discuss an urgent menu matter lisa
our school cafeteria is serving gmos -- genetically-modified organisms
and now in order to thoroughly explore the issue id like to play the first video that came up in my web browser when i typed in gmo plus danger plus question mark
hear-hear
if theres one thing scientists love its money money money money and thats been true of scientists ever since caveman times
we need look no further back than the ancient mayans who cross-bred plants and animals in an unholy experiment in what is now a resort that charges thirty dollars a night to valet park
once youre there theyve gotcha
the mayans didnt listen to themselves
yet today we toy with our fate by using retroviruses to create these so-called super foods are we doomed to repeat an event that destroyed all human life the answer is in your mouth
um that video seemed a little unscientific
my name is jenny mccarthy and i endorse this tirade
oh my god its worse than i thought everybody wait here while i do some actual research nobody form any opinions while im gone
well hurry we have no minds of our own
i say we do not categorically ban genetically modified organisms
well gmos are resistant to pests disease and drought its just possible that gmos can actually end world hunger
i say lets get these gmos inside our children pronto
way ahead of you
im eating the food of the future beep boop what is love boop beep boop
lisa id like to thank you for mollifying these land apes wed like you and your family to visit us at the monsarno research campus
ooh campus do you have a statue of the founder i can stick a funny hat on
go go go
simpsons were trying to change the world one molecule at a time
sounds like that would take a while
oh youre right everyone three molecules at a time
ill be home late honey yeah three molecules now
well its nice to see for once a corporation that does good work and cares about people

this is getting boring either murder us or tell us how you got here

the inanity of the vanity license plate puns was slowly driving me mad
so when monsarno labs asked for experimental subjects i gladly volunteered
my job was to make sure the experiments wouldnt be too painful for the test monkeys
i dont know what were doin here well pick it up after lunch
i wrote up my results and went from subject to scientist
look at me im sideshow bob

i like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters
another seminar tomorrow i just wish i could connect with those teenagers since it seems like well never have any
marge teens cant control their urges its why theres never been a teenage president
are you saying im wasting my time

hes touching her
what the--
theyre practically doin it here
ill sign the pledge just get your fat heaving buttocks out of my head

to the calder mobile
bob you saved me but how did you get the strength calders work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy
well put
thank you answer the question
well there is something i should have told you you see it occurred to me that if i can genetically modify fruits and vegetables why cant i modify me
youve been changing your dna
at first just a peptide here and there carrot for my presbyopia brahma bull for strength and a touch of corn for highlights on my hair
so how strong are you
figurines get your porcelain figurines
now how bout those impressionists
but but we sang gershwin together
well rhapsody in boo-hoo do you know why we came to the museum today
well i thought it was because it was tote bag day
well that was part of it
but the biggest part was that
washingtons backbone einsteins eyebrows florence nightingales tenacity though ill have to clip around her moral fiber
youre going to take dna from these historical figures and add it to your own
i shall be the wisest and strongest maniac ever to bring the blessings of dictatorship to the world
jigs up bob
return the spear to the homo erectus homo erectus where has that word been all my life
now bart i promised i wouldnt hurt you
you did that for me
more for mom but yes
but beware i have dna in me from ophiocordyceps unilateralis better known as zombie ant fungus
and were scared of that because
what i am saying is i could be tipped into a murderous rage by the slightest provocation
could you take a picture of me with my family
would you take another for safety
oh i think my eyes were shut in that one
now can you take one with my husbands camera
theyre all ugly because youre in them
taste praxiteles of athens
uh chief we got a report of a disturbance at the met
weve got bigger problems lou horny teens who should be out having bad sex but instead somebody made them take an abstinence pledge by the looks of it
i dont get it there are taboos about premarital sex in the middle east and you dont see those people getting all violent
you cant escape me ive got grasshopper thighs and the sonar of a killer whale
uh bob you cant kill us without a little singing right
a little singing if theres one thing he did not have to genetically enhance its his voice
non pi√ô andrai farfallone amoroso
how dare you torture my children with mozart
ahh you know mozart
i call all music mozart
were here to stop you -- with the help of the teenage abstinence class
if you defeat this madman ill release you from your pledge and teach you other fun ways not to get pregnant
i think i might be pregnant already
well thats one of them
python jaw unhinge
i dont wanna die in some old dudes mouth

milhouse played the violin for years until it turned out the vibrations were screwing up his bones
yeah these seem great oh too bad someone used cello rosin
oh my gosh thats beautiful ive never seen a painting with a lighthouse before
oh that that was on the wall of kirks bachelor pad back when we were separated
yeah its a great piece i didnt have a mirror so i shaved in the reflection of the chrome frame
this could be our new living room painting
i dont know how bout this poster of a really rockin jukebox
you know its rockin cause music notes are coming out of it
paintings only twenty bucks
oh please homie
ill throw in the tiny violins
oh it looks great
well to me it looks like garbage salad but thats the great thing about art everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks
ive got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from kirks bachelor bad i hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected
hey look theres a signature that the frame covered up johan oldenveldt
here he is johan oldenveldt painter lived in amsterdam paris prolific early 20th century naturalist i think this was painted by someone famous maybe its valuable
we should have it appraised
you guys are crazy ive never even heard of that guy its not like it was painted by leonardo da vinci code
now eres what makes art valuable 1 nudity 2 holograms 3 something terrible happening to jesus
ah yes seascape marvelous natural light classic use of gouache youre right this is an early-career oldenveldt quite valuable
oh my god
i expect it to go somewhere between eighty to one hundred thousand dollars
nobody touch it bart stop looking at it
but i want to see it
no youll wear it out
baby you saw something in this painting and you were right
wow the van houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth think how happy theyll be when we sell it and split the money with them
split it whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa split it with them
kirk and luann didnt know what the painting was worth when they sold it
yes they sold it to us so now its our painting we can hang it on our wall cut eyeholes in it to spy on people or sell it for lots of money which we keep
for ourselves
this dude gets it
but the van houtens are our friends
i dont know what youre talking about hide the treasure
are they marge if you think about it arent they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid
all our friends are like that
well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable
i would feel a happy for their good fortune b proud to know rich people and c grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake
how about this what if we give the van houtens twenty-five percent of the money
then theyll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that were keeping
marge you like kindness right
sure
so even if we gave kirk and luann some of money the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti
homer looks into marges eyes
its kinder never to tell them
okay i see your point we should sell the painting keep all the money and never ever tell the van houtens
whatll it take to buy your silence
okay milhouse the guys in back are putting your new bike together
and all i have to do is not say anything about some painting to my mom and dad
oh sweetie you want your parents to be happy dont you
i guess
i guess youre funny no wonder lisas in love with you
she is
she is
so if i keep my mouth shut you get me new wheelie sneakers and bart agrees to promote and encourage use of my new cool nickname cj
you got it ceej
you found out that painting was worth big bucks and you werent gonna tell us
we had a deal and now weve got nothing
we considered you our friends we trusted you i let homer use our master bathroom then you stab us in the back
if you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing how could you live with yourselves we were just trying to be kind
kind you call it kind to give us nothing
we were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why but now forget it
oh so thats how it is
thats exactly how it is
oh is it
oh it is
luann i hope were still on thursday for collecting used cellphones for the troops
i dont think you need any help youre so good at collecting
oh that was cold luann so cold brrrrr sarcastic brrrrrr
see what happens when we get greedy
honey theres something i wanna show you
an atm receipt
i dont know whose this is i found it next to the cash machine and ive always kept it look at the balance
five figures
with that painting we could have what these people have a money cushion no more living paycheck to paycheck one lost retainer away from the gutter
i could write a check with todays date on it
thats the cushion
oh definitely betrayal kent
interesting
so if you see the simpsons walking down your street lock your doors and hide your friendship
great now were raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world
dont worry no ones gonna see this stupid show
give back the painting the whole towns turned against us
you have no obligation to share the money from that painting ooo a support rock
this ones against us this ones for us for for against for against
we dont even get this many christmas cards
there they are the masterpiece thievers
ah shut your bone hole that painting belongs to the simpsons
sharing is what makes a community strong
all sales are final
you really think were still doing the right thing
just close your eyes and think of the cushion
first lot untitled landscape by johan oldenveldt from the collection of homer j and marge b simpson lets open the bidding at eighty thousand dollars

while you two were separated kirk and i used to be friends with banana-fits
you told me you didnt see anyone during our separation
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

kirk stole it from me but i didnt know it was valuable until i saw the story on tv

the auction is on hold until we can determine the true ownership
our cushion
dont bother coming home kirk
see what your greed has done
excuse me were trying to find caf√© artiste
anybody want to give me a ride home going once going twice
sold to the lonely auctioneer
thanks for taking me in man
i guess i cant help but feel fully responsible
oh luann ill never gaze from my thick eyeglasses into your thick eyeglasses ever again
what you need my friend is a canadian duff beauty eh
so why does that chick think she owns the painting
dawn and i went on a vacation to a resort island called isla verde i bought the painting in a caf√© but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor
not your fault man those parasailing guys take whatever they want
it was never her painting that woman will say anything to keep herself in electric cigarettes and id go back to that caf√© artiste to prove it but nothings gonna get me luann back
okay all i gotta do is take a quick ferry to isla verde find caf√© artiste and theyll back up kirks story that will prove the painting was his -- and now ours
oh homer simpson that painting has torn the town apart destroyed kirk and luanns marriage and everyones very worried about milhouse
hes been playing dancing revolution for hours but the tv is off
but our cushion
that picture has brought out the worst in everyone please just let it go
youre not gonna let it go are you
i wish i knew how
this is so exciting my first time establishing provenance
yeah yeah yeah just remember if your mother asks i took you to a wine tasting
thats a terrible thing for a father to do
thats why shell believe it
hmm this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy
ah yes top of the hill three discos up four gelatos on the left you cant miss it its right between the disco and the gelato place
welcome to caf√© artiste would you like a glass of strupo its a liqueur made of fermented capers the official drink of the island
sounds delicious its not hey a friend of mine uh bought a painting here
oh yes i remember that painting and that is the man i sold it to
and that man sold it to me
that proves the painting is mine and nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money
i love art
art what do you know about art you dont even know who painted that picture
yes we do its a johan oldenveldt
wrong its a me
what
i painted it me klaus ziegler
who
this is where i painted your so-called oldenveldt
prove it
oh crap
youre a forger
forger is such a cruel word im an art forger
your painting was an early clumsy effort which i gave to the caf√© owner to pay off my strupo tab
then why did the auction house say it was real
i have fooled galleries around the world with my loving imitations
ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler
what you do is horrible ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles
perhaps you are the one who is horrible
what
now lets play human foosball
you only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous

to try to avoid any misunderstandings in brazil like we had the last time im learning the language
ol√°
ol√°
eu amo o brasil
eu amo o brasil
o que √© um pa√≠s encantador
will you please turn that off its annoying the hell out of the flight crew
i was just trying to learn the--
everyone thinks they can learn our language on the plane do you know how disrespectful that is
all right just for that attitude turbulence
live from sao paulo we bring you the world cup round robin group f opening-round match
todays game is between our host country futbal powerhouse brazil
ol√â ol√â ol√â ol√â
and luxemburg whose entire nation has turned up
gotta hurry ive got nine hundred ninety-eight square miles to rob ha-ha
the mighty brazilian squad features the greatest master of the fake injury soccer has ever known el divo
aieee
and with brazil maintaining an insurmountable one goal lead lets take a look at the refs
it says here homer simpson was recruited for his honesty and utter disinterest
how did he get those shorts on over that arse
rumor has it they employed a team of pullers
brazil wins it and a fairly-called match it was
in choosing homer simpson the world cup has met its goooooooooooooooaaaaal
andres cantor you know that is incorrect usage
i have no controlllll this job has taken its tollll
eu gostaria de um hang on hang on placa de hang on hang on
here you go honey
howd you eat the meat without the vegetables
the stomach wants what it wants i need some air
ah brazil i couldnt stay afraid of you forever the only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream that is a deal breaker
homer simpson i would like to congratulate you on your fine officiating today
thanks i still cant believe the yellow and red cards dont stand for mustard and ketchup
your disbelief will fade with time but now i would like to know if you are as incorrupt√≠vel as they say
oh that is where i left my cellphone
well
you dont know the new me of the last few days at all
we will get to him we have our ways
what other ways besides guns and money
we have two ways two very good ways
red card
let me give that back to you
get outta here
and as homer officiates looks like weve got a little action on the bribe cam
man krusty should get some of these letters
while you were out the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts a chocolate bowling ball and a fresh pork sandwich
how fresh
wheres your mother
went to practice her portuguese
selecionar conta ooh select account
uh perhaps you could select the english option
i did not pay seven ninety-nine for an app so i could use the english option
you americans you really throw your seven ninety-nines around
you know youre pretty rude
stupid lady
give the donuts to the hotel staff release the pig and the bowling ball into the wild
dad is it hard for you to turn these bribes down
yes but knowing that lisa chose me as her hero without ever considering any other hero keeps me strong
why so quiet
im just examining what kind of person i am and whether i should destroy your happiness forever eh why not
im listening and it better be devastating
you werent lisas hero she just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero
oh my god thats thats shattering and now im a man in pain in the naughtiest city since san francisco turned all nerdy
where are you going
to drink until theres no pain left in my soul but first im gonna eat off someone elses room service tray that was left in the hall
now thats a broken man
what the hell are you doing
oh oh okay
so the rumors are true we knew youd find out your daughters original speech topic was marie curie and now we need you to fix the greatest game of all the world cup final
fine marge is always complaining i never fix things give me another
all right but weve run out of sugarcane
i carry my own
all right homer to begin your descent into hell let us enjoy this pirated copy of man of steel but beware superman was never less fun
here it is the world cup final
yay
will it be a german blitzkrieg or a brazilian waxing
nazis
nazi harborers
guys guys youre both right
if i bet it i could double it but on who
you know that brazil is going to win
thanks for telling me i was gonna tape it
remember ill be watching
wave a brazilian flag so youll stand out in the crowd
dont do it dad dont cheat
youre a funny one to tell me about deception
im sorry you werent my first choice in fact i had my doubts about using you at all
well if were going to be brutally honest that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness
you put it on the fridge
it was pity-fridged
all right youre hurt i understand but when i made you my hero you lived up to it and more you became the hero i thought you could be dad
oh come here
everythings right with the world
thats all right brain if i die ill be doing the thing i love the most trying not to get killed
this match is tighter than two dogs on a summer morn
theres no score at all even the slightest pebble could start a landslide
and el divo goes down in the box will homer award a penalty kick to brazil
do it do it call the penalty
no penalty he dove dad
no penalty
i repeat no penalty
no penalty
the game plus two hours of funeral time is about to conclude
and with germany the victor two-nil in an unprecedented display of rectitude and stubbornness by one homer simpson
ive never seen the brazilians so depressed
ol√â ol√â ol√â ol√â
you broke a deal with us and we have lost a fortune
well at least ill die the american way in a foreign country wearing short pants
wait wait wait wait i wanna say something
you have one minute wait let it get to the twelve nnnow

mom how could you pay someone to be my friend

i wouldve found a friend eventually you couldnt wait a damn decade until i got into college
lisa lisa wait
oh god oh god im the smart parent
im sorry she rejected your im sorry cake but in a way im not i guess what im trying to say is i like cake
marge dont feel bad you did what any parent would do
no i think i went too far
let me tell you a little story about a chubby unpopular boy named homer
is that the boy you named me after
it is you you idjit little homer had a devil of a time making friends no one wanted to come visit him
so i decided to take matters into my own hands
i paid a couple boys lenny and carl to make my homer feel loved
a relationship i continued to this day
you pay lenny and carl to be my friends
yes but barneys yours for nothin
hm well that makes me feel better
lisas doors unlocked
dad is that story really true
i wouldnt pay ten cents to a lion to stop him from eatin ya
lisa just say something to me
im gonna tell every psychiatrist i ever go to what you did
a mothers greatest fear
mom stop stop stop im sorry
please stop
youre not mad anymore
im fine fine its funny but hurting your feelings made me feel better
try to forget that
but when i grow up ill find other weird kids and we will have the most intense relationships ever and ill always love you
awww
happy mothers day
mothers day
crap
okay initially i was just gonna be your friend till i could afford a nice belt but i like you lisa and i want to keep being friends with you
great but from now on we have to be totally honest with each other
youre absolutely right

you will always be remembered for your countless appearances on the krusty the clown show and your one appearance on to catch a predator
hey ive spent a lifetime making people happy
yeah plastic surgeons and divorce lawyers
i was just about to say that he took my laugh screw it im doing it anyway plastic surgeons and divorce lawyers
what a legend krusty the clown is to comedy what martin luther king is to comedy

sarah silverman

and i guess i dont have any friends my only comfort is the roast is over and will only be shown four times a day for the rest of all time
krustyis your nose red because its embarrassed to be seen with you
nobody warned me this roast would treat me the same way as every roast ive seen and laughed at
and the husband says who paid you a nickel and the wife says everybody
oh sorry wrong for this audience i thought swapper jacks was something else
krusty sorry about the roast they had no right to say those hilarious things
how can they say im past my prime me the voice of ovaltine
krusty why dont you talk to your dad hell cheer you up hes a rabbi he mustve learned something from that giant star scroll hes always reading

well no but hes not a rabbi more of a flabbi
why you little ill show you whos a flabbi

all muscle in minnesota id be a supermodel
so basically i came here so you could tell me the truth that im great
as the torah says judgment belongs to god
the torah also says you cant eat ham and im the spokesman for hamco ham
this is why i only call you on christmas and easter
wait wait wait please dad do you even think im funny
im not gonna lie to you for funny i prefer rabbi rudenstein
he puts the ha in hanukah and the levity in leviticus
no no its a big thing
yes son we can
as for you son if you want to know my honest opinion of you youve always been eh
go on
ive always been eh ntertaining dad
show me nose fog
oh god hes dead and he never lived to see me be successful
a pusten fas hilcht hecher an empty barrel reverberates loudly and today my heart is that barrel
even though my father and i had our difficulties he was a great man and well he always
wha
eh eh eh
look im an entertainer so maybe the best way to say how i feel about my dad is through a song that someone else wrote that i hired people to sing this is for you dad
he fought and fought and fought for jewish rights wisdom sought students taught rabbi krustofskys gone
its just i thought seriously it can be really tough to lose your father
yasher co-ack
let us all please rise
homer get up

krusty i brought some homemade chicken soup we used the play-doh maker for the matzo
thanks but i dont really like soup
but you wear that little spoon around your neck
huh you really notice stuff dont you

eh
no thats what he called me eh
well it could be worse
oh yeah how
i dont know uh how about thats a lot worse
can you stop comforting me now
krusty condolences on your loss
so this is the bob whose comedic genius i can never live up to
believe me all of us have thought about killing him
clowns have it tough krusty i understand i was professor pickles with ringling brothers for several years
the elephant and i had our differences
so what brings you here and dont say clown car
im a sad tragic clown like whats his name liberace
tell me about your father huh
herschel did you read your exodus
oh uh oh sure

it said ow put me out how many talking bushes do you think there are
my son you are a big needy nothing that only laughs can fill
i dont need laughs

wow wow krusty would you like a therapy dog
yeah with extra relish hey-hey i still got it huh
yes if by it you mean reflexive denial of your inner sadness
hey-hey
shut up children
boys and girls you know that weve been dark for a couple of days because of a tragic loss in the krustylu family now put your hands together for the man whos falling apart before our eyes krusty the clown
no monologue roll the cartoon
oh my god who made this monstrosity
i did everything
kids im experiencing a crisis of conscience
no no no no i dont deserve the pre-recorded applause of children long gone
i like ike
therefore im quitting the show and i know mel will be quitting it with me
yes yes buy the house it will be-- what
today is the day the pity laughter died krusty the clown has retired
for a brief overview of a half century of ha-has here is channel six tv critic clive meriwether
krusty the clown will perhaps best be remembered for taking up two spots in the channel six parking lot
on a personal level he used to call me little lord tingaling i shant miss that this mans only lasting legacies are a law in his name limiting the working hours of chimpanzees to fourteen hours a day and the invention of the payment of alimony by dropping hot pennies from a helicopter i give his life a d-plus good day to you
what will krusty do now i suppose only time will tell which is true for all news stories i guess until anyone realizes im kent brockman adding no useful information and heres another sentence you can tell im winding it up because my voice is going up and down like this
well at least now ill have plenty of time to solve this rubiks cube
mom dad
yes lisa
ive been listening and dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes mind if i sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him
sweetie you shouldnt have to worry about such things
the doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep go to bed ill take care of him
no good no good what do i do what do i do
oh breathe homie breathe

why
in this new shelter we provide a home for animals put out of work by cirque du soleil
um krusty have you fulfilled the promise you made to your father in the dream you never told anyone about
no somehow a brief act of uncharacteristic generosity solved nothing
hey krusty
what have you been going to temple
yeah and ive learned that all religions are equally boring but theres a reason i went come and see
kid theres no way you can cheer me up not when whiskey good deeds and hookers failed
whos a hooker
um with me its easier to say which ones arent hookers
lisa what are you doing
wrapping you in bubble wrap i cant always be around to protect you so it will
but
oh lisa honey you cant insulate yourself from life why i could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow thats why i never plan more than four seconds ahead
i guess youre right
now come on give daddy a hug
bubble wrap
your daughterly love saved me sweetie

i suppose we should exchange insurance information i dont have any
me neither
then we have the same company theyll work it all out
rabbi rudenstein your fathers favorite

why is the captain just juggling
okay okay i can do this i can do this someone count me in

and now i banish you from paradise im glad i never bothered to learn which one of you is which
please show some compassion for two good people who just cant stop smoking
i know just the place
ohhh oooh tobacco
who needs paris this is our city of lights
flaming tap water i saw something about that in a documentary
sad sad sad sad sad sad sad sad sad cute this one
in this rural community hydraulic fracturing or fracking was greeted as a windfall
by pumping high-pressure liquid into underground shale deposits fracking releases natural gas but can lead to devastating environmental consequences
yep used to be you could try burnin yer water all day and nothing would happen
henry did you remember to turn off the slip n slide
i reckon not
i think someone is fracking under our neighborhood and i know who
its you mr texan oil wasnt enough now youre going after our natural gas
aw now aint nothing natural about gas
if you cant dance in it i aint drilling for it i dont do this for the money its the dancin its always been the dancin
oh man he made us watch him dance for three hours and he really only has one move
if someone was fracking in our neighborhood wouldnt we know it
maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue
this is clearly a fracking site how are they keeping people away
its a terrific sport that--
shhh
this whole building is just a fa√ßade for a drilling operation
indeed it is evergreen terrace is built atop a massive shale deposit
think of it all that poor natural gas trapped underneath your shanties and lean-tos smithers give these two brats what they deserve for sticking their noses in my business
stopping mr burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on beezus and ramona but i know someone who can help
the first female speaker of the state assembly
a politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need my hero
maxine lombard
charge the electric limo were going to springfield
what about your cool down period
what about it
lisa motorcade
assemblywoman lombard you got my emails
ill go anywhere anytime to defend our precious bay area values
oh terrible
just shocking does anybody have a baby we can hold near the flames
i guess i do
im gonna hit this mr burns with a politicians most powerful weapon an invitation to a committee hearing
mr burns do you admit that you illegally pumped toxic chemicals into the groundwater below evergreen terrace
i dont recall
mr burns have you no regard for the life and health of your fellow human beings
i dont recall
you cant drill underneath peoples homes without their permission as chairwoman of this committee on energy natural resources and blimp safety your fracking operation is hereby shut down
i demand to see that capitalism-castrating suffragette this instant
you havent bested me i will find a way to shatter that shale
what makes men like you think you can do whatever you want to our planet
maybe the planet wants a strong man to take her by the hand and lead her
you dont know what the planet wants
oh and i suppose you do
the planet wants to be protected and nourished and maybe even
kissed
wait a minute im not having a stroke am i
no am i
i dont think so
oh good
you
me
this was all a mistake an impulsive
knee-buckling
spanx-shredding mistake it was great
best ive ever had and that includes nellie taft
so monty should we find a way to continue this purely passionate affair
but youre a soft-hearted liberal
and youre a hard-hearted capitalist
now get out of my office
as soon as i collect my things
if i want to resume fracking
i have to buy the mineral rights for every single parcel of land in evergreen terrace to win people over ill need a salesman whose folksy fa√ßade masks a deep gusher of greed
congratulations simpson youre now my chief energy innovation marketing officer
woo-hoo
all youve got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors
woo-hoo i dont know fracking is one of those scary lisa words
bah fracking produces enough clean natural gas to make america independent of sheikhs caliphs and scandinavians not to mention it doesnt create any of that awful worker-mutating nuclear waste
homer game starts in an hour dont forget to set your fantasy lineup
thanks charlie maybe fracking isnt so bad
then say yes to this raise this promotion and this flannel shirt which says im not screwing you over
im not screwing you over no uh im not screwing you over im not screwing you over
im so proud of you poppa
some folks will tell you that frackings no good but what they dont tell you is hydraulic fracturing creates jobs
and all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what youre selling beer
authentic italian food
useless left-handed crap
magical nonsense
expensive toys for grownups they dont open or play with
pornography and nachos
high-quality spanish language programming
high-quality methamphetamines
laundry homework pranks poop poop and poop
but our water was on fire
how could you sell fracking for mr burns
because ive never gotten a promotion before once i thought i had but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing so judge me all you want
i am judging you
good judge away
judge-judge-judge--
pumping frack cash its a gas cash blast
residents of evergreen terrace are undecided whether to sell their mineral rights to mr burns
mr burns is a vampire sucking the life blood of this town and lining his coffin with cash
oh maxine no one insults me in a sound bite the way you do
oh monty youre such a sexy little nosferatu
same time tomorrow night ill bring the oxygen
better bring two tanks
and so we see a clear correlation between industrial hydro-compounds and water table contamination well outside the margin of error
mr simpson rebuttal
everyone who signs over their mineral rights to mr burns gets five thousand dollars
five thousand smackers
money is like a job you dont even have to do
aye dinero
signing stu
i think my arguments were more cogent
what
cogent
mr burns we did it everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights
excellent
well one
i have embarked on a beneficial friendship with a woman with whom i have nothing in common her opinions are abhorrent to me but the passion well look at these racy texts she sends me
oh baby
well im no carl when it comes to this stuff but i aint no lenny neither and i would say no matter how much you try to keep things casual someone always gets hurt
hmm well then i must harden my heart against such an outcome
glad i could be of help
do you have the signed gas leases
hold on this feels light one of these deeds is missing a signature
the gas rights transfer form for 742 evergreen terrace was never signed by marge simpson
marge why didnt you sign
our water was on fire
im sorry but the law states that unless every single resident sells their rights burns cant frack drop one
i was counting on that money to pay for my other calf implant
i already felt the pride of energy independence
marge simpson im as mad at you as you usually are at me
cheer up monty all you lost was money but what you get is me
all i lost was money let me make one thing perfectly clear -- our dalliance meant nothing to me you were but a sprig of parsley garnishing my beefsteak and now i cast you aside for the busboys to gnaw upon consider this ill-conceived affair terminated
i played this just perfectly
oh yeah great great marge great work thanks to you springfield will never be a natural gas boom town and like all boom towns it would have lasted forever
here they are
our water was on fire
was on fire was i finally get a job i was good at and now i have to give it up
so youve come begging not to be fired smithers turn my back on this man maximum huff
wait mr burns im here to man up -- it was all my wifes fault sometimes i think she and i have nothing in common
nothing in common eh tell me more
marge likes sushi i like gum that squirts in your mouth shes into romantic comedies i like movies where theres only one day a year when murder is legal yep marge and i see the world in totally different ways
different exactly thats why i had to give my woman the old heave-ho
so you dont miss that politics lady at all
not for one chinese second and im sure shes forgotten all about me
killdozers
whatever are you doing man
were tearing down this place and putting up a recycling center slash native american history museum slash condor sanctuary
a project this bloated and ill thought-out could only be the work of an angry liberal maxine
my ex is using the thing i hate most against me big government
stop this ribbon cutting this is private property
whats the matter mr burns never heard of eminent domain
youre just doing this to get back at me for dumping you
that is ridiculous
the antonin scalia bedroom
its a national public radio broadcast center now
who are you
im robert siegel and this is all things considered
stop laying about you theres work to be done
gravy thursday
even god hates jazz
if that woman thinks shes been scorned now she aint seen nothing yet
its fracking time
is one of the side effects of fracking earthquakes
y-e-e-e-s
what are you doing youre destroying this neighborhood
just like you destroyed my mansion
i dont know what i ever saw in you you planet-ruining monster
likewise you planet-saving succubus
homer turn off that horrible machine
you dont know anything about hydraulic fracturing youve just been brainwashed by liberal tv shows who use fracking as an easy bad guy but it can save this country
our water was on fire
wait i finally get what youre saying fracking is great but the only place it should ever happen is in other peoples towns
you always do the right thing sort of
what is he doing he was furious at that woman now hes embracing her he told me himself they had nothing in common
nothing except passion
i was a fool to break up with you maxine
im sorry i turned your home into a liberal paradise
you think we could make us work
i dont know were pretty different
but weve got passion and as long as weve got that our lives will never get boring
what color drawer pulls did you want -- nickel or brushed nickel
i wish we had bought the more expensive theater tickets ill never see anything in row bb
theres a sale on lawn furniture at the lawns plus
why are all cars black or grey now its like if you see a red one its a big deal
im thinking about wearing a watch again
wiggle in get comfortable
hey a couch is a couch
woo hoo
students each one of you has been assigned the mandatory honor of contributing to the springfield time capsulewhere your arcana will lie dormant until the thirty-first centuryand
by the time you finish talking were gonna be opening this damn capsule
right time capsule nelson give me something
i brought a picture of my dad
hes still at large in my heart
i brought my lucky rabbits foot i can have good luck without it

how about you bart let me guess you forgot to bring something
im offended you think i forgot lets see
ta-da

better make this count
my sandwich
and so a thousand years from now this capsule will be opened by some future mayor quimby
that-that could be anyones ooze
there
and now to help secure the jazz voteliser simpson will play her saxophone
a mysterious electrical storm is currently wreaking havoc with our studio but im not one of those brainless dolts who mindlessly reads a teleprompterrrrr error four-oh-one backslash backslash colon reset c-drive shutting down
what the hell was that
probably just another piece of americas space junk falling out of orbit
remember when this country didnt suck cause i dont
homer homer i think theres someone downstairs
relax marge its probably just homer comin home late from moes
the eyes in that picture are following me

oh what do i look like a narc my name is bender and i come from
the future

i dont know you die
oh my god hes telling the truth i have to take you to our civic leaders
hey hibachi head howre you gonna pay for that
uh let me just transfer some uh electronic hyper-credits into your register here
ding-a-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding ooh and uh another round for my friends ding-a-ding-ding-a-ding-ding
hey this blade rummy is all right hes a big spender plus he fixed the jukebox i think they had a thing going
oh baby what you done to me
i hate it when they get quiet
listen i-i know youre a robot and incapable of emotion
its true im empty inside
uh look i just wanna ask can we be friends
youre the only guy i know with less hair than me
sure thats why i came to your time for all you know
for all we know
doh
a strike a totally legitimate strike
yeah hey uh whats the robot version of bromance
romance
you future guys have a word for everything pal
you know they look a little similar
yeah like the guy who designed bender just took a drawing of dad and stuck an antenna on it
a little lazy if you ask me
regardless i see no reason to believe that bender is from the future robotic technology today is very advanced
oh really can your modern day robots do this
its not my birthday although maggies is pretty soon
i cant do maggie the gs look like sixes
this is the robot who claims to be from the future
can your present-day robots do this
no no they cannot not sure why theyd want to
now why are you here what is your mission uh so-to-speak
i dont remember
man this guy doesnt ask permission he just goes right in ya
aha benders mission protocol is definitely intact it just requires a delicate procedure known as unplug and replug
because that fixes everything
i remember why im here to kill homer simpson
my ears are burning
not yet but they will be
a boxing glove
but we bowled together
i cant do it
what stopped you bender asimovs three laws of robotics
you think robots care what some hack science fiction writer thinks i killed isaac asimov on the way over here well isaac somebody
what the my ass is about to project something
you dont have to announce it just do it quietly and blame the dog
bender weve just regained contact have you killed homer simpson
uh yep killed him good
if homers dead why are the creatures he begat still here and multiplying out of control
what the
you lied to me bender homer simpsons still alive
come on bender stabbity-stabbity
wait stop why must you kill my dad especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you
homer simpson must be eliminated immediately the creatures destroying new new york have his dna
the monsters are stealing our office supplies
thats inexcusable
um
hello robut looks like everyone gets a turn to say something this concludes my turn
we sent bender back in time to kill homer before the monsters could evolve from him apparently this was too heartless a task for a robot leela can you handle it
in a new new york minute minute
ow
ow right in my langwich centard
professor you-youre a fellow man of science maybe if we teamed up we could uh figure something out
okay but remember to me youre incredibly stupid
oh and the annoying girl may be helpful meanwhile leela take homer and explore this time period find out why people would ever pay for freemium games
ill explain okay it starts free right
then you visit your friends game and hes got this awesome candy mansion
get a load of those freaks
and youre like ninety-nine cents you bet id like one
and thats why i owe clash of candies twenty thousand dollars here we are
marge id like you to meet leela and fry
oh dont mention her eye dont mention her eye
dont mention her hair dont mention her hair
i am so pleased to meet you
nice to be hair
oh lord
professor farnsworth im dying to know how you got here was it a time machine
thats it all we have to do is dig up the time capsule
little girl time machines are physical impossibilities we teleported through a singularity that i quantum entangled to bender under the guise of fixing his collar
but how did bender get here
with a time machine
but you just said that--
samples ready
kill all humans kill all humans
start with flanders start with flanders
good news everyone
that means its bad
the human dna in the creatures was only half homers the other half came from someone else
oh so we can kill that person instead maybe theyre evil and deserve it or have one of those annoying voi-ces that gets on everybodys nerves with the adding extra noises for no reason bloing bloing
and the other person is
who is that
its me
wait a minute we dont have to kill you
well thats better
we just have to kill all your children
or just one of them if you can figure out which one sired the killer rabbits
we interrupt this hologram to bring you an important bulletin the horrific creatures destroying new new york have begun metamorphosing
eat my shorts aye carumba
what a surprise -- its bart
wow im doing the same jokes a thousand years later ay carumba
but how did a mere boy destroy the future
well
let this be a lesson never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule
and bury bart in the hole
i thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love like in epcot center
in our time epcot center is a work farm for the weak
oh but its not as crowded as the slave labor camps at universal studios
were here
my bowling buddy
hey
you cant dig that up for a thousand years plus i wrote my name there

well i shall stay here for the decadence theres no debauchery like end-of-the-world debauchery
your lips my lips apocalypse
i cant believe youre all giving up without a fight
lisa were just a package delivery service
and not a very good one
the only way to handle the creatures is to do what we do to each years super bowl losers -- shoot them into space but wed have to round them up first
let me take care of that if theres one thing i know how to do its manipulate barts
youre nuts ive got a will of iron
okay lets get goin

the blazing guy council of elders in conjunction with duraflame is very pleased to announce that this years ignis is jack lassen
so if we go there with a camera to film lassen humiliating himself ill get revenge for him making me into this

too bad hes missin this
so many musical choices
a brass band barbershop quintet the human kazoo ooh a drum circle

suddenly this place doesnt seem so bad
this place is great just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses
ooh are you mr clean
so give the tooth fairy my forwarding address cause its pretty loose

you dont count
maybe we should just give up on lassen
no this ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life and im gonna wreck it because he scarred me forever
hey it grew back a little better even so full and lush
enough
its like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain
get in the tent
you always save me trombone elephant
fire retardant
if lassen cant light that thing hell be humiliated what good is an ignis who cant blaze the guy
im scared bart and i am never scared

a place where my talents will be appreciated
all right thats lights out
you too freak

with every fiber of whats left of my wretched soul
we should team up i can get you out of here
a partner intriguing who gets to gut him like a little pot-bellied salmon
i assumed wed take turns
no deal
well if aint my next door neighbor king toot
moe
how many times i gotta tell you not to throw your trash in my dumpster
oh come on szyslak i gotta make space in the store for my new side business -- a tanning salon that secretly has cameras in the beds which feeds into my website www dot tancams dot com that is registered
hey sounds great maybe then you could afford to rent your own dumpster
i like my current deal free of charge
ill eat your hair

drive on asphalt cowboy -- or ill squeeze his brain out like an edamame
eh uh a what

oh salt peas i call them salt peas
look officer after twenty years of being neighbors tempers sometimes flare up moes a good guy
no no no its my fault im a hot head i aint got no beef with you toot
you better stay out of my dumpster
ive also been stealing the catalogs out of your mailbox
its my dumpster
and thats the terrifying tale of how the quebec nordiques became the colorado avalanche
oh no king toots is closed dad youre gonna have to take me to the big box music store
look at all these monstrosities
lisa how many times have i told you to bow down to our corporate overlords
impressed noise
its like some kind of guitar central
mid-life crisis at twelve oclock
mm-hm
okay let me guess dude youre an axe-man -- youre looking to score a new blade
stig youve got a name thats not a name
so whats your poison bro les paul straight up gibson no no no classic strat am i right
oh i dont have what it takes to play guitar i mean im no joe walsh in the brains department
who is look you dont have the weak womanly fingers of a guitar princess
you my friend have the muscular stumps of a bass man
try this on
what the rock
now that was a lick
i did a lick
keep em comin
yes now bob your head bob it bob it bob it
dude usually it takes years to learn such neck confidence now check this out
oh my god im amazing
dude youre already one of the greatest bass players of all time
okay now oh how are you set for stage lights
im not set at all
ooh what about gels
this is embarrassing to admit stig but i hadnt even thought about gels
what is that racket
music beautiful music
what
beautiful music baby
the bass guitar this doesnt really seem like you
sure it is you know ive always loved laying things down grooves are just the latest
i feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players like whats his name from the who or that guy from led zeppelin who wasnt page plant or bonham those are the only two i know for sure
its so cool to have another musician in the family
oh yeah and you know whats the great thing is about music its so easy
uh well to truly master an instrument youll need years of--
so easy
i cant take it all homer does is play that stupid bass doink doink doink doink doink doink doink
youre not alone marge
a man gets older has a career a few kids and suddenly theres a hole in his life that can only be filled by jamming for my julius it was the drums
timothy has that awful guitar
kirk just loves his keyboards
i never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming
oh my god oh my god oh my god what if -- all the dads jammed together in a dad band
that way they would play their horrible music in one garage at a time marge youre a genius
this menu was right -- good things do happen at zerz
i dont know guys im not sure im feeling this the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument
what were our wives thinking we probably dont even like the same tunes
on the count of three everyone say their favorite kind of music one two three
hard-driving rock
dads lets jam
garage bands rule
i almost forgot the most important thing
great practice guys what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day
excuse me my wife told me about your get-out-of-the-house band and uh perhaps you need a singer
oh yeah apu im sure youre a great singer but the balance of the band is really delicate right now and were not really looking for a world music vibe no disrespect to world music i love world music
when i close my eyes i wish that i could fantasize pull a dream right out of the air take a chance turn it into a prayer
that sounds nothing like terrible terrible world music
why is your voice different when you sing
it is because of all the years i spent at the kwik-e-mart
cause girl you know i wanna be the guy with a hunger burning deep inside tonight i wish upon a falling star to discover what my yearnings are
where classic rock anthems were piped-in on a never-ending loop the endless repetition drove many clerks to madness
the only way to maintain my sanity was to sing along until it seemed like our voices were one
hopin for a dream
hopin
focus like a laser beam ill keep fighting till i want something great hopin for a dream
guys are you feeling this are you feeling this
im feeling it
im definitely feeling it
i felt something earlier but i was afraid to bring it up
i think we all felt something
we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families we are now a cover band and we shall be called covercraft because we play covers and this is our craft
and it sounds like hovercraft
that was not my intent okay covercraft hands in
cover
craft
r o k c
okay this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new
apu whats wrong
what if what if i am no good this is the cabbage festival man i-i dont know if i can face that crowd
you dont know what a per diem is
i still want one
buddy buddy think of it this way youre not singing in front of all those people youre alone at the kwik-e-mart in the middle of the night you just wear this on stage and everything will be fine
my uniform
all alone at the kwik-e-mart
when i close my eyes i wish that i could fantasize
pull a dream right out of the air take a chance turn it into a prayer
girl you know i wanna be the guy with a hunger burning deep inside tonight i wish upon a falling star to discover what my yearnings are
everyone loves you dad you could become a famous rock star
well son i do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write down the names of and then cover but then i remember im just a regular guy jamming with my buds
oh sweetie this band has brought out the best in you
yeah you really get that its all about the music
yep its all about the music and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that pretty unforeseen
gentlemen i think weve found what were looking for
guys i really need your honesty here at the squidport senior jamboree was i too in the pocket
freddy freeman shredder stevens nick delacourt and peter dabbruzio -- youre four of the five guys from sungazer
but wheres your lead singer grant ledavid
uh he passed away
how
what kind of erotic asphyxiation
oh
hopin for a dream
apu youre the only man on the entire internet whose got the pure sungazer sound will you be our new lead singer and join us on our stadium tour
i think i can answer for apu hes flattered but the small-time success of covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted
uh actually i
apu has a rich life here in springfield a store full of great products a lovely him-type wife and eight super kids anoop sandeep nabendu gheet pria uma poonam sashi--
shut your mouth i want to do it i want to do it i want to be a singer for a real rock band
sun
gazer
i gotta say im kind of jealous of apu getting a break like that
not me im nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune
i want his fame and fortune so much why must the lords of rock be so cruel
sammy hagar youre not dead
dammit i told you these jalapeno poppers had too much breading
sorry se√±or hagar
nah nah nah its cool man i went to rock star heaven and there was this great back patio with a sweet fire pit if you had the right wrist band -- which i did
news story in aisle three local clerk apu nahasapeemapetilon is a dead ringer for a dead singer hes living the rock star dream as front man for 80s chart-toppers sungazer on their last final hell re-freezes over ultimate goodbye for serious this time never again part two of question mark tour
apu and the band appeared on saturday night live as the punchline in a game show sketch
whats a game show
its something you make sketches about
it looks like apu wont be playing the cabbage festival ever again
dad you shouldnt be jealous of apu remember its all about the music
hopin
im not jealous im envious jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have envy is wanting what someone else has what i feel is envy
wow hes right
you know what apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band were gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left
you mean more popular but not as good
phil collins-era genesis is not as good huh no reply at all land of confusion throwing it all away illegal alien i cant dance and im sure i dont need to mention invisible touch
you know we really could use a new lead singer
you know ive been known to sing a little
what so you can also get famous and bail on us youre out of the band
you cant just kick him out--
oh so youre sticking up for yoko here looks like ive got another yoko on my hands
how can there be two yokos--
yoko yoko yoko yoko yoko all you yokos are out of the band
are you okay
do i sound okay
you sound great your licks are really juicy
theyre not juicy my licks are dry dry and scratchy like a cats tongue
you didnt join a band to become famous like in almost famous you loved playing music with your friends that was enough to make you happy
well its not enough anymore when something great happens to one person everyone elses life gets a little worse look it up its called physics
apu is a good man he sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the costington center
oh you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star
stop feeling sorry for yourself your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him and you are coming with us to share in his talent
ill never have a per diem
apu wouldnt be able to sing a note if i didnt help him get over his stage fright with his kwik-e-mart shirt
backstage pass you just became a payback rage pass
look at all this rock star dressing room stuff what a sellout cheese plate -- oh sorry cubed cheese plate lemon tea probably for his throat
lets see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt
but mr shredder you promised me after we played my hometown i could have a day off
i also promised id kick heroin
but the tour is so hard on my family my octuplets are being raised by roadies and bodyguards
this is not proper
look apu for twenty-five years we wasted money on women drugs and guitars with live fish inside and now we want to keep it going
you signed a contract for a three year fifty-seven country tour at union scale -- no per diem
youre in the band
oh well i guess its show time
homer
im sorry apu i thought you were living your dream life so naturally i wanted to ruin it but now i know things stink so im okay with it
what is the point i am trapped like a kwik-e-mart hot dog on a roller
kwik-e-mart hot dog eh
you want every hot dog in the store every one o-kay
ladies and gentlemen tucks medicated pads presents sungazer
uh people i am sorry to report that all the original members of the band have been struck down by a mysterious case of hot dog poisoning
rather than refund your money or reschedule the show we have a surprise for you get ready to rock with a group that is truly all about the music -- covercraft
focus like a laser beam ill keep fighting till i want something great hopin for a dream hopin for a dream
hopin
to someday somehow have a goal ill keep fighting till i want something great im hopin for a dream
hopin hopin hopin
hopin for a dream
hopin
dreams are great or so it seems if i never find one i guess thats okay im hopin for a dream
hopin hopin

this ass is most disagreeable
the creatures are composed of completely indigestible toxins
these humans have been poisoned by their unhealthy fast-food diet

youd be better off chewing tobacco like the boy

dad said i could try it
homer
dont you people realize your queen is dying
im afraid the lardo speaks the truth your majesty
its all right i have seen many glories and have only one regret that my breasts arent bigger
i dont see any breasts

useless humans we will send you back to your planet and your memories will fade so it will be as if none of this ever happened

no no no musk you tricked me
not a trick we sacrifice now to take care of the future in a way totally determined by me
oh all i wanted was to make obscene profits in the last year of my life and leave it to no one why does god hate dreamers
due to recent fluctuations in my judgment and the once-in-a-lifetime mistake of trusting another human being i am saddened to announce massive layoffs
who will pay for my radiation sickness treatments
not my concern
but musk was our savior
your so-called savior isnt interested in saving anything but the world bah
burns layoffs have thrown the city into a new depression marked by the singing of songs from the old depression if youre old enough to have suffered then and now why dont you sing along

wow youre good at that
its gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships
sir i have my concerns about the team of hit men youve assembled they seem a little long in the tooth
nonsense just because a man cant see or hold his hand steady doesnt make him any less of a marksman
and our dentists are all self-taught
a yoga mat that rolls itself up silent velcro baseball tickets that guide you to your seat
sweet columbia exposition musk lives
but uh three of your hit men dont recoil was pretty bad
oh my god oh my god you saved my life which is gonna make what im about to say even more awkward
whatever you want well make it work right homer
elon elon elon i want to say something to you and i dont want you to be inspired by it i want you to listen
no
i dont want to be with you anymore
can i ask why
i could say its the being shot at or the flat emotionless way you talk or the fact that paypal was my idea and i was just about to do it when you came out with it but really its that this town isnt ready for you and neither am i
its okay ill be fine
its on your face too
well ive saved you one last prize from the cracker jack box that is my brain use it as you will
on a miami dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet
why are they always the most beautiful just when theyre breaking up with you
i think its time to tell my luggage to self-pack
goodbye elon our town will never forgive you
thanks for the real working light saber
ay carumba
i just wanted to see if there was a better life even for a little bit
when youre sixteen ill drive you to cincinnati and youll see what there is to see
mr musk before you go is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future wont be as grim as all our current movies forecast
i guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time
hm for a man who likes electric cars he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel
whats wrong dad
nothing
elons log earthdate 25 january 2015 i have left springfield forever but there are some things i will definitely miss
the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet wearing a helmet wearing a helmet
i never thought id say this but sometimes holograms miss the point
and i regret to inform you our soviet sister city springograd has disappeared from the map
now id like to welcome our beloved four-time mayor hans moleman
springfielders rejoice what is the one thing our blessed little town has lacked
a human zoo
what we lack is a town anthem and youre in luck because i have written one mr largo if you please
um-hm
stop the anthem
i was in tuscaloosa on vacation it started out great they got a jernt there called moes original barbecue
but then i heard their city anthem give a listen
only tuscaloosa
guns are only for celebratin what do you do with them when youre angry
now calm down this could just be an amazing musical coincidence
there aint no coincidences in popular songs boney
only austin only oakland only calgary only provo ulan bator area fifty-one
weve been singing this song like it only belonged to us when every city in america has had its lips on it even des moines
wait a minute this song was supposedly written by former mayor moleman
i met a guy a wonderful guy
i didnt write it i bought it from a salesman who was selling it to half the towns in america i didnt think youd find out because i never thought any of us would ever go anywhere
well then what do i do with this
now i cant be buried in a jewish cemetery
please be merciful
hyah
boy sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change
as mayor i balanced the budget eight times
i still believe in this town a town that deserves its own original song and as an aspiring musician with off-broadway dreams im the one to write it
so ordered
ill write that song
pharrell williams
im sorry everyone but the eight-year-old girl got there first
hyah
shelbyville rules springfield drools
lets see what rhymes with jebediah
tire fire
how about patty and selma
fatty and smell-ya
mr teeny
sister weenie
lisa is blown away

bart i need your help to write a new anthem for springfield will you team up with me
hmmm whats in it for me
uh ill make brownies later

i think we might just make a good team like maggie and grampa
what are you doing
whats it look like writing a song
artists
we did it we wrote an awesome song
we make a great brother and sister team like andy and lana wachowski
should we hug
hm how about a fist bump through a towel
that works
i saved us seats
oh thank you homie
thank you roll of masking tape
gonna be a tight fit
springfields the only home weve got
but to be frank theres not a lot to recommend it
weve got a big sinkhole
and they shut down the thinkhole
hashtag springfield pride has never ever trend-ed
this is not boosterism
warm up the horse
but when you think of the things we lack
stead of the stuff weve got
why springfield why not
weve only had a hurricane once
we havent had a circus fire in months
springfield -- why not
were just off the interstate
the second right off exit eight
he didnt blow his line sarah lets have another
you may find our culture lacking
we finally outlawed our snake whacking
sure our cops are easily bought
but hooray for springfield give two cheers smallpox-free for seven years
why springfield why noooooooooot

a paparazzo please dont send that if my father sees it it will ruin my life
well thanks for making it so easy
and you have the twenty million goats
two now nineteen million nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety eight on delivery
very good
um shouldnt we see how the princess is doing before you sign your majesty
what are you talking about smithers
i cant even trust you to watch an impetuous adult who does what she wants the deal is off
wow after spending my life serving others im finally gonna get what i want
sir there may be a bright side
theres never a bright side
hes almost mine
yes youve torn that up all right
father i want to explain i was a young woman who wanted to see the world and this kind man has shown it to me
and stolen your heart
eh well thats what i do sorry but there aint no off switch for this
he has not stolen my heart
wha
why has he made the ancient tribal sound of confusion
i think he is a sweet sweet man but when i kissed him on the forehead it was not romantic more like when snow white kissed dopey
no no not this comparison again
im sorry moe i dont love you but i really like you
well daughter even though you have done nothing seriously wrong first i will tear this contract one more time
and as for you your punishment will be
uh may i speak to you majesty father to father
a woman has allowed you to sire her children
there was beer involved i have two daughters and ive learned you have to let them go their own way even the one-year-old
majesty
and the older one i cant tell her what to do and shes only twelve
eight
see what i mean always an argument
but the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them
i am not convinced
uh because you want them to grow
still not convinced
and because you cant strangle a girl
that makes sense
come here daughter
oh father
little girl let me give you some advice never dream big because it will blow up in your face
youre talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz
poor thing
so the good kings cheap uranium will allow me to sell you expensive nuclear power everyone wins
yes yes princess can you tell us about the man you kissed
ill field that yesterday a local man may or may not have given a tour to a certain princess who uh one assumes turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect
and yesterday a certain princess may or may not have seen much of your world with a certain man and she certainly might be eternally grateful
oh this is vague stuff vague stuff
i did not think this through
moe before i left i just wanted to give you these examples of our most beloved albeit depressing literature
ah some nice bedtime readin
fun premise
im laughing already
really not cheerin me up here but uh let me offer you the only literature in this bar sure works for me though
this coaster
i will treasure it
well i guess youll pine forever for a man who doesnt care while i just grow old here in this bar
heres to suffering in silence
cant wait to see those numbers hanging from my rafters
i cant believe its been three years since smithers left man have i been aging badly but i guess i can finally wash this forehead
divine
oh god what do you want
well neighbor now that your streak of rum luck is at its end i have a favor to ask
it involves charity
ive set up the virgin earth challenge a twenty-five million dollar prize to eliminate greenhouse gasses that i was hoping you would add to
you never let me tell
where are the hounds when i need them
theyre on a free virgin galactic flight around the world
can you go five blasted minutes without saying the word virgin
thats another virgin challenge that i will not be virgin taking virgin
love you guys
jet pack of course im clancy wiggins you idiot
chief clancy jetpack
okay okay i think i got it
now i got it i got it
oof why dont you take that thing off chief its starting to smell
what so you can steal it and be sky police ohhh no no way
um oh well theres only one floating future cop who can find that missing jet pack -- the sky police
this is the end of sky police
you were the wind beneath my ass
what percentage of prayers really come true
well not all of them like um ninety percent
god doesnt hear my prayers if he did id be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper
oh god gets your prayers but he just clicks delete without reading them like email updates from linkedin
i hope no one was hurt
dont worry reverend according to your policy your church is covered for everything but acts of god
mom the freezer broke and--
but we believe everything that happens everywhere is an act of god
my jiminy youre right were off the hook
go southern illinois
saluki strut
its a mixed-use nightmare
but you dont go to our church
granted i do not share your faith but the yahoos in this town need a church to deliver weekly reminders not to steal -- from me not to take a life -- my life
without organized religion ive lost me moral compass also ive uh ive been addicted to oxy for a while now yar
now this is what i have got in mind
i will whisper even though we are alone
marge has brought this heathen to aid us in our time of need
please do not call me a heathen it offends hanuman the monkey-headed lord of winds who believed the sun to be a ripe mango okay i get it i get why you say it
apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack
the casino
blackjacks for suckers my brother he used to own three arbys franchises -- lost em all at the tables and gave himself a shotgun tonsillectomy
what i told you was to wait in the car
the mumbai institute of tantric sex where i was recruited by a card-counting ring
am i hearing this right is the church council truly considering gambling
you know ned the bible never explicitly condemns gambling biblical folks were always playing games of chance like uh drawing lots
card counting is not gambling it is math
and its not even against the rules
dad mom trusted us with a secret--
exactly if you are caught you cannot be charged with any crime the worst they will do is beat you with a phone book or break some fingers but what is a little pain if your church is to be saved
it is all good
counting cards requires absolute focus you must ignore all casino distractions
and beware of cocktail waitresses with free drinks and eyeball-height cleavage theyre not attractive but you cannot look away
freshen your drink hon who had the scotch and soda cocktails cocktails another one hon
you -- what is the count
get your head in the game mel
remember for this legal but-frowned-upon scheme to work we must have complete secrecy do not tell anyone what you are doing
not even homer
homer is many things but not a good accomplice if he gets involved and this scheme fails what happens to our church
even i saw that i guess i cant tell homer
well to raise money were putting on a revue
yeah so uh im going out to rehearse the revue
go go make magic you just go
revue
card counting is simple
you all sit at different tables betting low playing hand after hand counting in your head how many high cards are left in the deck
ignore all distractions
when the count is high you have a hot deck and the odds are in your favor then you use a secret signal to call in the closer
the closer bets big wins bigger and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally-acceptable screw job
#NAME?
but use caution there are eyes everywhere sooner or later the casino will catch on
what a haul
i think we can do something a little harder than that
mmm now thats a marshmallow-y smore-garita
oh boy oh boy
one am lovin and two am steak night marriage rules i guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue
huh oh yeah yeah yeah the revue
what are the skits about
uh pop culture and current events
how do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades
both
nice you know it wouldnt be a revue without songs tell me about one
okay theres a song about um how democrats and republicans cant get along its called cats and dogs
you got yourself one hell of a show marge one hell of a show
okay okay dont get cocky you rapture-waiting baby-baptizers you had one good night but now the casino is on to you theyre not going to let you anywhere near those blackjack tables unless you wear these
disguises im worried that our scam is becoming dishonest
why i bet the lord is pleased as punch that were using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple our mission is one hundred percent pure
where has this been all my life
i could be sideshow anyone
im telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes
im telling her
cook all the tater tots there were too many tots and the teachers took them home in manila envelopes i hate you
ok mel ill be at the casino by ten meet me at the lounge by the j geils cover band
are you a hostess
actually my friends and i are using a system to win money to save the church
i cant believe youre gambling
its not gambling its math
is dad in on this takedown
its not a takedown and i havent told him about it -- yet
but its okay for you guys to know because youre finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information
yeah we are grown up
i know how much to tip a waiter
i go on hikes with my friends where we talk about our problems
ill tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money but until then i appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret
homie homie i can finally tell you how we really got the money
marge some casino guys have me and they want the money you took from them or else
this is all my fault
just tell me one thing marge why did you lose faith in the revue i mean cats and dogs writes itself cats and dogs on capital hill they dont get along and never will
cats and dogs squabbles never ending even with so much legislation pending
homie how did you end up at the casino
well i was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap
moms counting cards at the casino
if anything happens to marge well all be orphans
im comin for ya baby
have you seen this woman have you have you seen my wife
this is your wife
do you know where she is
uh wed like to ask you some questions in our beating room
all right as long as its just questions
reverend reverend they took homer
oh asphodel
your corpse bride is getting cold
uh one second belladonna helen and i have found that uh these new personas have been quite liberating
was that a womans voice send her in
if we dont give back the money we won counting cards the casino people are going to hurt homer
are you gonna put my head in a vise
we dont do that we dont even have a vise
we just want the money your wife stole from us
stole how is counting cards stealing
well its not really stealing
is it even cheating
no but-- its just not allowed
i dont get it football players can do the quarterback sneak and baseball players can steal bases why cant i just remember which cards have been played
i cant take any more of this guy get the vise
i knew you had a vise i knew it
im sorry marge maybe your husbands suffering was all part of gods plan
gods plan god isnt some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs god isnt sky police god didnt do this i lied to my husband and made my kids lie too we did this
shes right we thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed but we were scathed those free ginger ales at the casino i didnt declare them on my taxes
im going to do what i shouldve done in the first place
put on a revue
i dont know if you watch us all the time or if were just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels weve built
maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe and im going to sit here and focus on that good and maybe just maybe ill get my husband back
my family loves your microwave lasagnas
its not my division but ill tell bill kelley you said so
i want my husband back
hm let me run it by jennifer yang oh wait shes on maternity leave dont worry im sure chuck bennett will sign off on it
we are going to release your husband
see marge someone up in the sky did hear your prayers
they sure did casino management
you are free to leave as long as your faith-based card counting group never return to this or any other river or maritime casino
no deal
but we dont need to come back we saved the church
no an injustice has gone on here for too long
im not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards theyre just playing the game by the rules
homie after all this do you still believe in god

featuring the waylon smithers dancers
and the springfield baggy-pants players
and now a family that doesnt know the meaning of the word cancelled -- the simpsons
ah i said mmph
so lets review you two screwballs have just strolled in here fresh from the sewer and given me a bunch of bulldink about creating itchy with no proof at all and you expect me to give you how much
thats a lie
well i dont think i am under oath but yes my father created them all except for flatulent fox that was based on a true story but he did create itchy thats one thing i am sure of
this isnt a saxophone its an umbrella
okay maybe my dad did steal itchy but so what animation is built on plagiarism if it werent for someone plagiarizing the honeymooners we wouldnt have the flintstones if someone hadnt ripped off sergeant bilko thered be no top cat huckleberry hound chief wiggum yogi bear andy griffith edward g robinson art carney your honor you take away our right to steal ideas--

unadulterated pap

where is homer anyway
its so typical of the big doofus to spoil it all
what aunt patty
oh nothing dear im just trashing your father
well i wish you wouldnt because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings hes the only father i have therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships so i hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me and i am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts
um-hm go watch your cartoon show dear
come on bart kiss the ticket for good luck not that we need it heh-heh-heh

dont worry dad maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens
around the clubhouse turn whirlwind is staking out a big lead a couple of lengths quadruped fighting it out and coming up fast chew my shoe

rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose and if you ever saw it you would even say it glowed
like a light bulb
bart
all of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
like shine-ola
lisa
they never let poor rudolph join in any reindeer games
like strip poker
im warning you two
then one foggy christmas eve santa came to say
take it homer
rudolph with your nose over here so you can guide my sleigh today
oh homer
then all the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee rudolph the red nosed reindeer youll go down in history
like attila the hun
come on mom

two points your turn dear
nurturing
hmmmm how could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters
oh wait heres a good one -- do
id triple word score
hey no abbreviations
not id dad id its a word
as in this game is stup-id
hey shut up boy
yeah bart youre supposed to be developing verbal abilities for your big aptitude test tomorrow
we could look this id thing up in the dictionary
we got one
i think its under the short leg of the couch
id along with the ego and the superego one of three components of the psyche
get outta here
my turn kwyjibo k-w-y-j-i-b-o
twenty-two points plus triple word score plus fifty points for using all my letters games over im outta here
wait a minute you little cheater youre not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is
kwyjibo uh a big dumb balding
north american ape with no chin
and a short temper
ill show you a big dumb balding ape
uh-oh kwyjibo on the loose
you there no chewing gum on school grounds in the trash can with it
principal skinner one of my fellow children is vandalizing school property
oh where
over there sir see
look out bart here comes skinner
yikes
umm whoever did this is in very deep trouble
and a sloppy speller too the preferred spelling of wiener is w-i-e-n-e-r although e-i is an acceptable ethnic variant
good boy boys lets see your hands
mmm-hmm good okay simpson
you might say you caught him red-handed
simpson you and i are going to have a little talk
same time same place
yes in my office after school
oooh
bart i hope you wont bear some sort of simple-minded grudge against me i was merely trying to fend off the desecration of the school building
eat my shorts
pardon
now i dont want you to worry class these tests will have no effect on your grades they merely determine your future social status and financial success if any
mrs krabappel isnt bart supposed to face the window so he wont be tempted to look at his neighbors paper
youre right martin bart
remember to visualize the complex problems and relax the test will start now
at seven-thirty am an express train traveling sixty miles an hour leaves santa fe bound for phoenix five hundred and twenty miles away
shhhhh visualize it bart
at the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves phoenix bound for santa fe
its eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car
an hour later a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off but three times as many plus six get on
oof
at the second stop half the passengers plus two get off but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop
ticket please
i dont have a ticket
come with me boy
weve got a stowaway sir
twice the fare from tucson to flagstaff minus two thirds of the fare from albuquerque to el paso
yaaaaahhh
bart there are students in this class with a chance to do well will you stop bothering them
hes not bothering me mrs krabappel im finished may i go outside and read under a tree
certainly martin
what are you looking at bart are those naughty dogs back again
you have twenty minutes class
hes a good boy now and hes getting better and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard
thats exactly the kind of crapola thats lousing him up hey look at this i am a weiner he sure is
mr and mrs simpson are here
send them in
hello again principal skinner
what have you done this time boy
i caught your son defacing school property this morning we estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and frankly we think its terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill
yeah its a crummy system but what are you gonna do
oh no he cant mean that
my wife thinks you want me to pay for it
that was the idea
oh
by itself something like this might not call for an extreme penaltybut this is not an isolated incident barts behavior is unruly hes frequently absent from school then gives teachers pathetic excuse notesthat are obviously childish forgeries when compared to
well at any rate it is my reluctant decision --
mr skinner doctor pryor is here to see you he says its urgent
send him in
were radioactive
mr and mrs simpson this our district psychiatrist dr j loren pryor
what do we need a psychiatrist for we know our kid is nuts
oh on the contrary i have some very exciting news for all of us this aptitude test we administered this morning has revealed that young bart here is what we call a gifted child
a what
your son is a genius mr simpson
bart
this lunkhead
impossible
no no were quite certain the child is not supposed to know his own iq of course but uh you can see its beyond the range of any doubt
nine hundred and twelve
uh no you have it upside down its two hundred and sixteen
oh
thats still amazingly high
tell me bart are you ever bored in school
oh you bet
um-hmmm ever feel a little frustrated
all the time sir
uh-huh do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis
wow its like youre readin my mind man
a-ha you see when a child with barts intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person hes probably going to lash out in ways like these
i think we should re-test him
no no i think we should move him to another school
oh better yet
bart wed like you to try a kind of school that doesnt rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers a school without walls where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to does that sound good bart
sign me up doc
come on bart your mothers only trying to help so go ahead and enjoy the show
excellent were all set then heres all the information you need show up around nine-ish mr and mrs simpson congratulations once again
i think were all in a mood to celebrate
doc this is all too much i mean my son a genius -- how does it happen
well genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment
uh although in some cases its a total mystery
aw come on mom
you look very intelligent dear
no way
how bout a tie son everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties
youre stifling my creativity dad
sorry boy
bart this is a big day for you why dont you eat something a little more nutritious
nonsense marge frosty krusty flakes are what got him where he is today
it could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart lisa maybe you should try some of this
homer
im just saying why not have two geniuses in the family sort of a spare in case barts brain blows up
i dont care what that stupid test says bart youre a dimwit
maybe so but from now on this dimwit is on easy street
no rush dad take the scenic route
gotcha
oh no ties
dont worry son you can have mine here let me show you how to put on a tie
the hook goes over the top and these things go in there
thanks dad
you kissed me
nurturing your brilliant brain so i got tickets to the opera tonight hurry up get dressed it starts at eight
well there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son i think now go on boy and pay attention because if you do one day you may achieve something that we simpsons have dreamed about for generations you may outsmart someone
you must be bart simpson im ms melon your learning coordinator
let me say right at the start that we have one rule here make your own rules if you feel sleepy take a nap if you get bored feel free to take out a book and start reading
what should i read maam
why anything you want bart
ohhh
a comic book how did this get mixed in here we used it last week as a prop in a film we made about illiteracy
bart these are the students who will share your work area this is ethan foley
o memsahib bart rabbi has memo
what
ethan is very good with palindromes -- you know sentences spelled the same backwards and forwards and this is sidney swift
trab ing norm doog
whats your problem
oh dont mind sidney hes just speaking in backwards phonetics today he said good morning bart and this is cecile shapiro
hi bart

hi lil control hamster
i wouldnt get too attached bart were dissecting him next week

now lets all welcome the newest member of our collective experience bart simpson
and now we can continue our debate from yesterday when we left off calvin and tanya were arguing that free will is an illusion
oh mom not tonight
homer youre going too
if you ask me humankind has freedom a freedom fraught with paradoxes freud shows how childhood shapes our subconscious mind but this helps us to think for ourselves
very good ian does anyone else have an example of a paradox
without law and order man has no freedom
if you want peace you must prepare for war
um-hmm um-hmm well it seems the smartest child in the class is also the quietest bart what other paradoxes affect our lives
well youre damned if you do and youre damned if you dont
well i guess that would be a paradox too thank you bart
whew
tell you what bart ill trade you the weight of a bowling ball on the eighth moon of jupiter from my lunch for the weight of a feather on the second moon of neptune from your lunch
well okay
there you go
i will trade you one thousand picoliters of my milk for four gills of yours
well all right
anything you say
uh bart would you wager your cupcake against my
save your breath
what do you think of the new kid
a rather mediocre genius

the fat guy on tv
boxing lisa boxing theres a world of difference
gee homer are you sure this is the right thing to do
honey ive given this matter a lot of study and of all the commercials i saw his was the best all it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars
but we dont have that kind of money
well then were just going to have to dig deep marge go get the kids college fund
hey
oh homer
oh come on marge why scrimp now on the off-chance that theyll actually get in someplace

well were not licked yet to save this family were gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice
no dad please dont pawn the tv
oh cmon dad anything but that
homer couldnt we pawn my engagement ring instead
now i appreciate that honey but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here
afternoon simpson so what can i do for you

hey no pain no gain
will you be paying by cash or check
cash of course ive got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me im holding it right now here it is look check it out two hundred and fifty big ones
if you really want to impress her show her the big empty space where our tv used to be
bart
come on family lets go celebrate our new found ability to express love for each other im taking you out for frosty chocolate milkshakes
there go my young-girl dreams of vassar
hello im dr marvin monroe no doubt you recognize me from tv
we would if we had one
lisa
no no homer dont stifle the youngster your family must feel free to express itself thats what these pads and jumbo markers are for i want you to draw for me your fears your anxieties the roots of your unhappiness now take a deep cleansing breathand begin
no surprises here homer
homer what have you got for us homer
whoops sorry i wasnt paying attention
well if you had been paying attention perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority figure - an ogre if you will
now doctor thats not true
ogre is such a strong word
right on doc another successful diagnosis
whoa okay you want to kill each other thats good thats healthy theres nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict all i ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets
good idea
all right
i dont know
okay lets take another deep cleansing breath
wait a minute these mallet things are padded with foam rubber whats the point
theyd work much better without the padding doc
no no thats not true
see
ow gimme that
yes well that concludes this portion of our treatment
are we cured yet
dont be ridiculous you will be cured but its going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods
unortho what
dont worry ill have plenty of time to explain while i warm up the electric generator
everyone comfy good now dont touch any of those buttons in front of you for a very important reason ie you are wired in to the rest of your family you have the ability to shock them and they have the ability to shock--
arrrgh
just testing
why you
no homer not yet
you see this is what is known as aversion therapy when someone hurts you emotionally you will hurt them physically and gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all and wont that be wonderful homer

what on earth are you talking about homer
the code of the school yard marge the rules that teach a boy to be a man lets see dont tattle always make fun of those different from you never say anything unless youre sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do hmmm what else
i know
oh homer thats ridiculous bart instead of fighting why dont you try a little understanding
what do you mean mom
yeah right this ought to be good for a laugh
shh this bully friend of yours is he a little on the chunky side
yeah - hes pretty chunkified all right
huh huh and ill bet he doesnt do well in his studies either
no hes pretty dumb hes in all the same special classes i am
thats why he lashes out at the world
aw marge
so tomorrow instead of bickering with this boy talk to him youll be surprised how far a little understanding will go
well thank you very much mrs maharishi gandhi lets go boy
now heres that bully of yours show me your stuff
no no not like that like this
see that boy you didnt expect that did you and neither will he
you mean i should fight dirty dad
unfortunately son we simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own
amen
so the next time this bully thinks youre gonna throw a punch you throw a glob of mud in his eyes and then you sock him when hes staggering around blinded
yeah
and theres nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned
gotcha

bigfoot the legendary half-man half-ape is no longer a legend hes very very real what you are about to see is unedited video footage taken earlier today in the hills three miles southwest of tenderfoot gorge
plemk heh feh
now the naturalist who took these absolutely extraordinary pictures was most impressed by the creatures uncivilized look its foul language and most of all its indescribable stench
a popular supermarket tabloid has offered a reward of 5000 to anyone who brings in the creature alive naturally well have more on this story as soon as it develops we now return you to the presidents address already in progress
it looks like you girls have been getting along all right but its a good thing we found you when we did theres something horrible roaming these woods
there is
why thats my husband
his name isnt bigfoot his name is homer
what does it eat
i dont understand whats this all about well i suppose pork chops are his favorite
hey get those bears out of here im trying to do an interview

dad oh dad
avenge me son avenge my death
last weeks capture of bigfoot has turned into the scientific poser of the century although the creature was ultimately released the question remains who was this homer was it man or was it in fact the legendary missing link known as bigfoot
can i have some apple sauce
specialists from around the world have gathered at the springfield primate institute for a firsthand examination of the controversial creature they are now ready to announce their findings
ladies and gentlemen distinguished colleagues after extensive biological and anatomical testing i regret to announce that the evidence we have is inconclusive this thing may or may not be human
zats vhat he thinks i say its none other than bigfoot in the flesh
i disagree i think eet eez a man ze eyes had a glimmer of human intelligence
the glimmer of the eyes what about the sloping apelike forehead
oh marge the guys at work are going to have a field day with this
cheer up homer at least they let you go
gentlemen gentlemen fraulein please zis much ve can agree upon the specimen is either a below average human being or a brilliant beast

well i was wondering how important is it to be popular
im glad you asked son being popular is the most important thing in the world
so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better
youre not talking about killing anyone are you
no
are you
no
then run along you little scamp a boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center
what have i done
bart are you all right
oh yeah top of the world ma
well then come down for breakfast
oooh look at this one the hammer of thor it will send your pins to valhalla lisa
valhalla is where vikings go when they die
ooooh thats some ball
g-o-o-o-d morning everybody
we interrupt mambo in the morning to bring you this special news bulletin the statue of jebediah springfield our illustrious town founder was brutally decapitated last night in an act of senseless vandalism we now go to police chief wiggum at city hall
i gotta go
i think she likes my present better
well we have no witnesses no suspects and no leads if anyone has any information please dial oh and ask for the police that number again oh
stay tuned to this station for further developments as they break
its just a statue
its a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town
its a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it
just a statue is the statue of liberty just a statue is the leaning tower of piza just a statue
uh-oh school bus
cmon lis school bus
go on lisa weve all got to be brave just like jebediah when he killed that bear
its so awful
okay come on come on everybody weve got to get on with our lives lets try and put this tragedy behind us
youre right moe a beer please and make sure theres a head on it
ohhhh
ive said it before and ill say it again hell in a handbasket i hope they find the punk who did this and i hope they cut his head off
hi guys whats up
we were just saying wed love to meet the guy who cut off the head of that statue
yeah we wish he were here right now
oh really
yeah wed break every bone in his stupid little body
yeah thats right man limb by limb
yeah man
what but but yesterday didnt you say it would be cool to cut off the head and really cheese everybody off
that was just cloud talk man
yeah i mean throwin rocks is one thing but i would never cut the head off of a guy who iced a bear with his bare hands so whats in the bag bart
my head
i said whats in the bag bart
look what youve done you want to be popular now youre the most hated boy in town
youre not really talking to me youre just my overactive imagination
oh i am am i
shut up i wanted them to like me
ummm the child seems rattled
can you blame him
no no i cant
there there mr burns blow sir
hey bart where you going
to my room
why dont you watch krusty the clown
there is someone out there in krustyland who has committed an atrocity if you know who cut off jebediahs head i dont care if its your brother your sister your daddy or your mommy turn them in and krusty will send you a free slide whistle just like sideshow bobs
wait a minute i hope youre not planning to do what i think youre doing
sorry man its either you or me
you know bart you dont have to found a town to be a hero sometimes a hero can be a young boy with the courage to stand up and admit hes made a mistake
yeah well im running a little short on courage right now
anyway think about will you son
jebediah obediah zachariah jedediah springfield came west in 1838
along the way he met a ferocious bear and killed him with his bare thats b-a-r-e hands although modern historians recently uncovered evidence that the bear in fact probably killed him but whether bear killed man or man killed bear a burgeoning town springfield was born
mom dad
i knew it all along
why bart why
yeah why you little
um-hm its an accident waiting to happen
cause i wanted some really bad kids to like me somehow i got the idea that being popular was the most important thing in the world
where did you get a ridiculous idea like that
lay off the boy marge hes a good kid quit givin him the third degree
homer did you have something to do with this
well maybe i am a little responsible
a little
cmon son lets take the head thing back to the authorities
you know bart when i was your age i pulled a few boners but i think youll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half oh oh
look there it is the head
kill him
we know this part
oh yeah right
well thats my story and if you still want to tear apart this young sunday school student as he stands on the brink of salvation i await your wrath
oohhh
somehow i dont feel like killing anymore
neither do i
dad

oh hello principal skinner id get up but the boy crippled me
mmm-hmm i understand completely the disturbing incident i was referring to happened this morning when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys lavatory
that old gag
unfortunately at the same moment my mother was in the girls lavatory making use of the facilities
oh dear
mr and mrs simpson we have transcended incorrigible i dont think suspension or expulsion will do the trick i think it behooves us all to consider deportation
deportation you mean kick bart out of the country
hear him out marge
well perhaps i was being a tad glib let me explain our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program now normally a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence but in barts case im prepared to make a big exception and if youre willing to play along he can spend the next three months studying far far away
sounds great although a kid cant learn much in just three months
homer you didnt even ask where bart would be going
actually hed be staying in france in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country
but bart doesnt speak french
oh when hes totally immersed in a foreign language the average child can become fluent in weeks
yeah but what about bart
im sure hell pick up enough to get by and the whole thing wont cost you a dime as long youre willing to take in a student of your own
wait a minute skinner how do we know some principal over in france isnt pulling the same scam you are
well for one thing you wouldnt be getting a french boy you would be getting an albanian
you mean all white with pink eyes
no no no no a student from albania its a country on the adriatic sea
well going to france sounds like a fantastic opportunity but i think bart should have a say in this
aah the life of a frog thats the life for me
bart how would you like to spend the next three months living in france
france wow
he makes me crazy twelve months a year at least you get the summer off
mmm-hmm
and id get to take a plane there wouldnt i mom
yes bart
wow and one back

yes yes

sorry man be my guest
you may find his accent peculiar certain aspects of his culture may seem absurd perhaps even offensive but i urge you all to give little adil the benefit of the doubt in this way and only in this way can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world
thank you principal skinner thank you fellow students although i have only been in your country a few days i have already found americans to be most trusting although officially i am required to hate you i want you to know i do not feel it in my heart
hurry up boy my grapes are waiting for their water

im defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want
can not

youre my best friend
thanks krusty
buy my cereal
buy my cereal
i didnt do it
i wish i could believe you
good evening again springfield krusty the clown the beloved idol of countless tots now nothing more than a common alleged criminal his trial which begins tomorrow has taken center ring in a national media circus as children of all ages from eight to eighty hang on each new development like so many rumanian trapeze artists
from his humble beginnings as a street mime in tupelo mississippi
krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire --
-- with dozens of endorsements including his own line of pork products this may have led to one of televisions best-loved bloopers -- krustys near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986
sorry son youll understand one day
wasnt that a great itchy and scratchy cartoon kids well weve got another one coming right up but first i got a hankerin for some pork products
mmmm look plump succulent sausage honey-smoked bacon and glistening sizzling
im dying im dying
but a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later krusty bounced back however he was a changed clown where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike as simple-minded tv mayhem
this new krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in todays anything-for-a- thrill youth
give a hoot read a book
krustys arrest has sent shock waves through springfield packing its churches synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizenry from all walks of life
i urge every halfway decent member of our community to gather up all merchandise that bears the likeness of krusty that clown prince of corruption and join me in a public burning
so is krusty the clown about to trade in his baggy pants for the relatively snug uniform of springfield penitentiary well find out tomorrow when his trial begins
what kind of gun did you use
did you use an accomplice
will you plead insanity
look at him his clothes are so drab
his face is so flesh-colored and sad
and his feet theyre so small
say it aint so krusty
my client has no comment at this time
i didnt do it
krusty the clown how do you plead
i plead guilty your honor
uh i mean not guilty opening night jitters your honor
i would like to call to the stand homer j simpson
dont do it dad please dont do it
hes innocent i tell you krusty would never do something like that ah come on dad you gotta listen to me
mr simpson was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of heavily-salted snack treats
yes sir
hmmm hmmm do you recognize the gunman in this courtroom today
yes i do
fine would you point him out to us
okay
oh man
let the record show that the witness eventually pointed to krusty the clown
these toys are just adorable whod have guessed they were inspired by an insane criminal genius
but dad youre giving in to mob mentality
no im not im hopping on the bandwagon now come on son get with the winning team
hey right here krusty souvenirs buy em and burn em right here
good people im so happy youre all here tonight but please just a few words of caution now we are going to set this pile of evil ablaze but because these are childrens toys the fire will spread quickly so please stand back and try not to inhale the toxic fumes
ahhhhh oooh
krusty would you please turn your attention to exhibit b and tell me what you see
which one do you mean
the one with the big b on it
uh uh
whats the matter cant you read
no i cant i cant read or write i admit it im totally illiterate now are you happy
can it be that the champion of child literacy cant even read himself
is it a crime to be illiterate
so
yeah al last name koholic
all right all right see this krusty this is a b and this is exhibit b betting slips obtained by this court indicating you have lost substantial sums of money on sports gambling --
is it a crime to bet on sporting events
yes it is
oh
foreperson have you reached a verdict
yes we have your honor we find the defendant krusty the clown guilty
i knew it this happens to me every time
my young friends for years i have been silent save for the crude glissandos of this primitive wind instrument but now destiny has thrust me into the center ring in the coming weeks you will notice some rather sweeping changes in our program please do not be alarmed itchy and scratchy will still have a home here but we will also learn about nutrition self-esteem etiquette and all the lively arts
what the hell are you doing lis
im watching sideshow bob you know hes a lot less patronizing than krusty used to be
you backstabber you traitor you
snap out of it bart face the facts all those hours we spent staring at krusty we were staring at a crook
look lisa i know krustys innocent dont ask me why its just a feeling i have
oh bart
come on lisa i think i can prove krustys innocent but i need your help
you do why
oh come on lis you know why
no why
ill never forgive you for making me say this but youre smarter than me
so you with me
yeah man
okay okay dont try anything funny im armed to the teeth
bart look
so i dont have a pacemaker
come on bart the tape showed that the robber heated up a burrito
dont you remember the get-well card we sent to krusty it was after his heart attack when he had a pacemaker put in
ah ha
wait a minute krusty cant read
okay okay so the poor guy cant read cant we get off his back already
no dont you get it bart how could krusty have been reading a magazine if he cant read
hey hey this is not a lending library if youre not going to buy that thing put it down or ill blow your heads off
bart im starting to think youre right krusty was framed did he have any enemies
i dont know but i know someone who would krustys best friend in the whole world sideshow bob
a volley of musketry flamed thundered roared a profound silence followed broken only by the approaching footsteps of the third brigade
next week chapter thirty five of the man in the iron mask-the death of a titan
well kids thats our show for the day and now the words of mr cole porter
every time we say goodbye i die a little every time we say goodbye i wonder why a little every time we say goodbye goodbye
great show sideshow switchboards were jammed the kids love you
thanks ted im glad weve finally dispelled the myth that im too uptown for the tots and yet i cant help thinking about poor krusty
we see your face on key chains
#NAME?
#NAME?
this is all very exciting but i think wed do well to explore the more upscale market for instance sideshow bob limited edition prints collectors plates commemorative coins
some kids are here to see you sideshow bob they say its important
ah well we can sign these contracts tomorrow
certainly i take great pride in being able to sign my own name
sideshow bob can we ask you a few--
forgive me children as much as sideshow bob would love to chat he has a show starting in moments here you go three tickets be my guest
well okay but
come come lets run along
hello children whom do you love
sideshow bob
come on bart go with the flow
how much do you love me
with all our hearts
about a zillionth as much as i love krusty
todays show promises to be a marvelous celebration of the human spirit but first i regret to say i see a youngster who looks troubled
whats your name young man
bart simpson sir
mmm well perhaps we can shed some light on your problem in a new segment exploring pre-adolescent turmoil i call it choices
i dont think so sir
bart im reaching out to you
so whats on your mind bart i bet the other children dont accept you
true sideshow bob but that doesnt bother me you see my sisters and i have been doing a little investigating and it looks to us like krusty was framed
framed
well the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the kwik-e-mart but krusty couldnt go near the thing not with his pacemaker
well you know bart as much as i love krusty he was never one to take doctors orders too seriously
well maybe but get this krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the springfield review of books
ah well bart
the fact is you dont have to be able to read to enjoy the springfield
review of books just look at these amusing caricatures of gore vidal and susan sontag
yeah i guess those are kinda funny
bart children this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us but we must get on with our lives lets try to remember krusty not as a hardened criminal but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car
and shot you out of a cannon
and shot me out of a cannon yes we will never forget that will we bart open your heart i admit i have some mighty big shoes to fill but if you give me a chance i promise you wont be disap
big shoes to fill big shoes to fill big shoes to fill
you know in ancient greece there was a school of thought called stoicist
wait a minute you did it
excuse me
attention fellow children krusty didnt rob that store sideshow bob framed him and i got proof
ow my foot you lousy stupid clumsy
see that krusty wore big floppy shoes but hes got little feet like all good-hearted people
sideshow bob really fills his shoe with big ugly feet
the kids right
how do you figure we missed that
get off your duffs boys get down to that studio
yes i admit it i hated him his hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years i played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites thats why i framed krusty i would have gotten away with it too if it werent for these meddling kids
take him away boys
treat kids as equals theyre people too theyre smarter than you think they were smart enough to catch me
well we made a terrible terrible mistake uh wont happen again
it better not you dimwit
krusty im man enough to admit i was wrong and im sorry i fingered you in court i sincerely hope that the horrible stories i heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated
okay lets see next we have
well the important thing is that i regained the trust of the children but there was one boy who trusted me all along bart
yes sir

hey dr j
i think what we have on our hands here is a classic case of what laymen refer to as fear of failure as a result bart is an underachiever and yet he seems to be how should i put this proud of it
hmmm
one of his problems may be his short attention span which can lead to
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
hmmm huh
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

every other student in the class has shown at least some form of improvement and yet you continue to struggle why is that
i dunno

well maybe it would help him to be left back it wont be so bad bart
no i mean it you cant hold me back i swear im gonna do better look at my eyes see the sincerity see the conviction see the fear as god is my witness i can pass the fourth grade
and if you dont at least youll be bigger than the other kids

otto you know i respect you i mean you always let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns
damn thing never goes over does it
so whats in your head little man

oh homer
cant you see
hello
yes sir i hope i didnt overstep my bounds
you are so beautiful to me
i love you homer
i love you karl -- marge
proceed smithers
our first issue sir is our low productivity and record-high worker accident rate
any suggestions
a round of layoffs might wake up the idiots
we could put caffeine in the water cooler
well those are my ideas you people dont think you regurgitate thats why i promoted someone whos in touch with the workers you
i think you mean him sir
you then how would you improve the worker situation
well sir for one thing we had a problem every tuesday when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks
fish sticks what in blazes are you talking about
well sir they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them
i know what fish sticks are get to the point
well you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and i always run out
will you stop wasting our time simpson
shut up smithers cant you see what hes saying a happy worker is a busy worker three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor i like the cut of your jib simpson let the fools have their tar-tar sauce
enjoy your tartar sauce boys enjoy give me your plates dont crowd plenty for everybody
hmmm brilliant who could have ever imagined that simpsons sweeping reforms would pay off so quickly
you know sir accidents decreased by exactly the number that simpson himself is known or suspected to have caused last month and our output level was just as high during simpsons last vacation
my dear tired old smithers do i detect a note of jealousy
it is time give simpson the key
mr simpson dont sit on that filthy thing one second longer theyve given you the key
the key
stunning absolutely stunning
oh hey ho men you know i was watching the dumont last night and i happened to catch a fascinating documentary on rommel the desert fox now theres a man who could get things done

karl so that wasnt just a sweet voice i heard inside my head what are you doing here
i just came to say goodbye to the gals in the typing pool
yeah well thanks for the speech karl but i cant give it look at me

hes crazy
yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day bloated inventories outmoded production methods -- i can save this company millions of dollars a year how through jiko kanri the japanese art of self-management you see in the west the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost for a net savings of

hello something scary happening
hey poindexter its halloween put the book away
for your information im about to read you a classic tale of terror by edgar allan poe
wait a minute thats a schoolbook
dont worry bart you wont learn anything
its called the raven
once upon a midnight dreary
while i pondered weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
huh
like what
as of someone gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
tis some visitor
i muttered
#NAME?
are we scared yet
bart hes establishing mood
ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow -- vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow
-- sorrow for the lost lenore --
oh lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore -- nameless here for evermore
aag
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- this it is and nothing more
presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
sir --
-- said i --
#NAME?
here i opened wide the door --
this better be good
darkness there and nothing more
you know what would have been scarier than nothing
what
anything
back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before
surely --
-- said i --
-- surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore --
mr burns in twenty years i have never seen such a shoddy deplorable --
open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door -- perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door -- perched and sat and nothing more
though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou --
i said --
#NAME?
quoth the raven
eat my shorts
bart stop it he says nevermore thats all hell ever say
okay okay
then methought the air grew denser perfumed by some unseen censer
ouch censer
swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor
wretch --
i cried --
#NAME?
quoth the raven
nevermore
be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend
i shrieked of starting
get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore oh leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken -- quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven
nevermore
take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven
nevermore
why you little --
uh-oh
come back here now raven
nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore
and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted -- nevermore
lisa that wasnt scary not even for a poem
well it was written in 1845 maybe people were easier to scare back then
well yeah like when you look at friday the 13th part i its pretty tame by todays standards
children bedtime
i guess ill have no trouble gettin to sleep tonight

mr burns i am going to overlook this felony however i will not overlook the three hundred and forty-two violations i have observed at your plant today either bring this place up to code or well shut it down good-day

they say were contaminating the planet
well nobodys perfect
why cant the government just get off our backs
you know i was just telling the wife that if i was governor id do things a lot differently
oh get off your soapbox simpson do you realize how much it costs to run for office more than any honest man can afford
i bet you could afford it though
uh dont get me wrong i mean youre an honest man i just meant that you could afford to run for governor if you felt like it course im just rambling because uh because you keep staring at me like that but but its true i mean if you were governor you could decide whats safe and what isnt
where are we going sir
to create a new and better world
if its on the way could you drop me off at my house
well hes got my vote
homer were a mary bailey family
mary bailey isnt going to fire me if i dont vote for her im for monty burns
oooo a political discussion at our table i feel like a kennedy
well frankly i dont see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against mary bailey the most beloved governor our great state has ever known
now heres the problem as i see it while governor bailey is beloved by all ninety-eight percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse thats why weve assembled the finest campaign team money can buy this is your speech writer
huh uh
your joke writer
huh uh
your spin doctor
huh uh
your make-up man
yeah
and your personal trainer
oooo
their job to turn this mr burns
into this
why are my teeth showing like that
because youre smiling
ah excellent this is exactly the kind of trickery im paying you for but but how do we turn your average joe sixpack against mary bailey
with this team of investigators your muckraker
how do you do
your character assassin
nice to meet you
your mudslinger
ah
your garbologist
hello
their job is to turn mary bailey from thisinto this
visual aids help so much thank you
but first theres a burning issue that we need to address and neutralize immediately
i hate that fish
thank you for watching movie for a dreary afternoon please stay tuned for a paid political announcement brought to you by the friends of montgomery burns
burns change the channel
you change it
no you change it
i changed it last week
fine be a jerk then well just sit here and watch it
oh no an election thats one of those deals where they close the bars isnt it
sorry barney
i wonder if hes going to say anything about that horrible fish
oh marge whats the big deal i bet before the papers blew this out of proportion you didnt even know how many eyes a fish had
thirty seconds to air mr burns
now remember to smile
i am smiling
youll have to do better than that
hows this
there you go
im going to be sore tomorrow
well weve done all we can mr burns the rest is up to you
oh dont worry --
#NAME?
oh hello friends im montgomery burns your next governor and im here to talk to you about my little friend here blinky
many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation nothing could be further from the truth but dont take my word for it lets ask an actor portraying charles darwin what he thinks
hello mr burns
oh hello charles be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection
glad to mr burns you see every so often mother nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth sharper claws longer legs or in this case a third eye and if these variations turn out to be an improvement the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the face of the earth
so youre saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish it may in fact be a kind of super fish
i wouldnt mind having a third eye would you
no you see friends if our anti-nuclear naysayers and choose-up-siders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant theyd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman
the truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that cant be beat mmmm mmmm so to summarize say what you want about me i can take the slings and arrows but stop slandering poor defenseless blinky good night and god bless
only a moron wouldnt cast his votefor monty burns
wow super fish
i wish the government would get off his back
that burns is just what this state needs young blood
i hope burns and i can count on your support honey
homer im a bailey booster
oh yeah well im a burns booster ow
congratulations mr burns the latest polls show youre up six points
giving me a total of
six but were on our way
my worthy opponent seems to think that the voters of this state are gullible fools i however prefer to rely on their intelligence and good judgment
and i say taxes are too high
have you found any dirt on mary bailey
well weve gone through her garbage
weve talked to her maid
and so far the only negative thing we have found is from some guy who dated her when she was sixteen
ah and
he felt her up
bah not good enough
were gonna send - a message - to those bureaucrats - down there in the state capital
is your boss governor yet
not yet son not yet
the voters now see you as imperial and god-like
hot dog
but theres a downside to it the latest polls indicate youre in danger of losing touch with the common man
oh dear heaven forefend
which is why the night before the election we want you to have dinner at the home of one of your workers
oh i get your angle every joe meatball and sally housecoat in this god-forsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with eddie punchclock the media will have a field day
the only question is -- can we find someone common enough
well i i knew there would be sacrifices
ah great toast marge hmmm oh by the way the night before the election mr burns is coming over for dinner
what
and some reporters and camera crews but you dont need to feed them
cool man a media circus
absolutely not
come on marge
huh uh im going to be ringing doorbells for mary bailey that night
kids please leave the room i dont want you to see this
uh oh
please please please please please please please please please please
were hoping that one of the children might pop up with a question about the upcoming election little girl do you think you can memorize this by dinner time tomorrow
mr burns your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train why are you so popular
very good
hmmm well as long as im asking something can i ask him to assuage my fears that hes contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable
no dear the card question will be fine
well i think the non-card question is a valid one
marge dont worry my daughters very bright im sure shell be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow
only an innocent child could get away with such blasphemy god bless them all amen
and finally mr burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him but we must remind you he hates being touched
marge get back in bed
no im just fine right here
whats wrong i just want to snuggle
well i dont feel like snuggling
whats that got to do with it
i dont want to snuggle with anybody whos not letting me express myself
but you do get to express yourself in the lovely home you keep and the food you serve
okay homer fair enough you got it all right good thats it thats how im gonna express myself thats right goodnight
huh
well what do we think
hey hello handsome
hey get that stuff off his face were here to have dinner with the common man not tyrone power
the latest polls are in its dead even -- fifty-fifty this cornball stunt is gonna put us over the top
whoa hes here
hello homer marge you look dazzling oh and look ive brought noodle kugel
bad dog bad neighbor dog here let me help you up mr burns
i love dogs babies too
aaaah kitty kitty
are you all right mr burns
oh of course a little roughhousing with the pets is good for a mans appetite
the latest polls are in the statesman-like way you handled the pet incident has put you over the top youre ahead fifty-one to forty-nine congratulations mr governor
excellent
bart would you like to say grace
dear god we paid for all this stuff ourselves so thanks for nothin
hes smokin hes smokin
you know mr burns my family and i feel that taxes are too high where do you stand on this highly controversial issue
goodness i didnt realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate
i was only reading what the card
homer i agree with you and if im elected governor i will lower taxes whether those bureaucrats in the state capital like it or not
lisa do you have a question you would like to ask your uncle montgomery
yes sir a very inane one mr burns your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train why are you so popular
oooh a tough question but a fair one lisa theres no single answer some voters respond to my integrity others are more impressed with my incorruptibility still others by my determination to lower taxes and the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it
oh mom that felt awful
im sorry dear it will all be over soon
but mom weve become the tools of evil
lisa youre learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt
some cant even get a fair shake or even a square deal ummmm smells delightful
all right three eyed fish
can i have your plate mr burns
ruined before it hit the ground
get me the city desk
heres your headline phil burns cant swallow own story
the latest polls indicate burns popularity has plummeted to earth like so much half-chewed fish
you must have a few tricks left up your sleeves smithers boil some coffee were not licked yet
yes we are come on boys the old guys finished
wait come back you cant do this to me im charles montgomery burns
smithers tip over this table for me

mr burns i hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish
shes right take me home smithers well destroy something tasteful
ironic isnt it smithers this anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the election and yet if i were to have them killed i would be the one to go to jail thats democracy for you
you are noble and poetic in defeat sir
simpson i shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled
uh oh youre busted dad
oh my dreams will go unfulfilled oh no i dont like the sound of that one bit that means i have nothing to hope for marge make it better please cant you make it better huh
homer when a mans biggest dreams include seconds on dessert occasional snuggling and sleeping till noon on weekends no one man can destroy them
hey you did it

lisa honey youre forgetting the beer it comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here
i hope youll space out the tubs this year homer
what are you getting at
well last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire

all right this will be fun oh say you looked like you were having a little trouble there
that shot is impossible jack nicholson himself couldnt make it
it is difficult mr simpson the best strategy is to play conservatively hug the rail it wont go in but you set yourself up for an easy deuce
oh well huh it went in
good shot toddsky
luck
final score bart forty-one homer lets see six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six
never mind

hi bart
homer i couldnt help overhearing you warp barts mind
and
well im worried that youre making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament
but marge this is our big chance to show up the flanderses
well im sure it is but why do we want to do that
because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad and im tired of making other people feel good about themselves
hi bart whatre you doing
lis what do you call those guys in chess that dont matter
absolutely eeeeeeeer
well a blockaded bishop is of little value but i think youre referring to a pawn
right i am a pawn
i know its times like this that im thankful dad has little to no interest in almost everything i do bart i think i can help you
our journey begins here at the library
hi lisa
hi mrs norton
hi lisa
hi ralph
hi lisa
hey gang okay bart this is the card catalog
lets see golf anecdotes eisenhower and fashion humor japanese obsession with ah here it is putting
and finally the most important book of all the tao te ching by lao tzu
lisa we cant afford all these books
bart were just gonna borrow them
oh heh heh gotcha
i want you to shut off the logical part of your mind
okay
embrace nothingness
you got it
become like an uncarved stone
done
bart youre just pretending to know what im talking about
TRUE
well its very frustrating
ill bet
bart i have a riddle for you whats the sound of one hand clapping
piece of cake
no bart its a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer its supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought
no answer lisa listen up
lets try another one if a tree falls in the woods and no ones around does it make a sound
i said now
but bart how can a sound exist if theres no one there to hear it
woooooooo
it is time
the basis of this game seems to be simple geometry all you have to do is hit the ball here
i cant believe it youve actually found a practical use for geometry
bart whatre you doing get down from there before the neighbors see --
hey simpson
flanders i dont care what this looks like barts gonna mop the floor with your sons ugly butt
well sir may the best man win
ah may the best man win the mating call of the loser
now just a minute simpson i think my son has a very good chance
oh yeah wanna bet
yeah well im not a betting man
oh im a chicken am i
thats right
all right hows this for a wager a batch of your wifes delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wifes homemade wind chimes
what are you afraid to make a real bet
no i just --
you know simpson youre starting to annoy me
how about this henny penny if bart wins tomorrow you have to mow my lawn
all right and if todd wins you have to mow my lawn and do a decent job of it for a change
better yet you have to mow my lawn in your wifes sunday dress
you have yourself a bet you jackaninny
read that back to me marge
the father of the loser mows the lawn --
eh eh just a minute loser is such a harsh word couldnt we just say the boy who doesnt win
oh man fine
the father of the boy who doesnt win has to mow the lawn in his wifes sunday dress
there you go
now i suppose you both have to sign this i hope blood wont be necessary
im game if you are flanders
good gravy what have i done
keep your left arm straight bart rotate your shoulders
dad
look son all im asking is that you try
okay ill try
anybody can try i want you to win
homer
marge give me your honest opinion this or this
good morning son oh by the way todays the day of the big tournament and youd better win
dad
see you downstairs boy
heh heh that crazy marmaduke
eighth hole
aim for the octopus third tentacle
twelfth hole
bank it off the pink tombstone
nirvana
a state of bliss attained through the extinction of the self
here you go bart a lumberjacks breakfast for my little golfer
mom bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates steak will make him logy
ohhh well what wont make him logy
oatmeal
oatmeal
oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the kentucky derby
news flash lisa bart is not a horse eat your steak boy
mom do i have to
good afternoon everybody and welcome to the finale of what has already been a stirring afternoon of miniature golf the cream has risen the wheat has bid farewell to the chaff and now we approach the championship match with but two warriors remaining the heretofore unknown bart simpson and todd flanders one of the most skilled ten-year-olds to ever take back the blade
bart having never received any words of encouragement myself im not sure how theyre supposed to sound but here goes i believe in you
thanks man
hey flanders its no use praying i already did the same thing and we cant both win
actually simpson we were praying that no one gets hurt
oh well flan-ders it doesnt matter this time tomorrow youll be wearing high heels
no you will
fraid not
fraid so
fraid not
fraid so
fraid not infinity
fraid so infinity plus one
young flanders has the honor and will tee off first
its got a chance yes sir
oh man
tree falling in the woods tree falling in the woods tree falling in
and the battle is well and truly joined
woo-hoo-hoo
mercy is for the weak todd
if one were to look up courage in the oxford english dictionary one might very well come upon a photo of these two gladiators they approach the final hole in the shadow of the great emancipator deadlocked at eight strokes on the happy side of par soon one man will emerge triumphant he will drink naught but champagne while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in this oft cruel game
its okay son you can recover
come on bart remember what vince lombardi said if you lose youre out of the family
homer
ow
neither man showing his best form this sort of pressure can unhinge even the steeliest of competitors
this is pretty tense isnt it todd
yeah my knees are shaking ive got butterflies in my stomach but i guess this builds character
who wants to build character lets quit
okay
we decided were equally good
we want to call it a draw man
ladies and gentlemen we have a draw
you will forgive an old brit for crying but this is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since mountbatten gave india back to the punjabs
put her there man
yeah all right
well homer our kids showed us something today huh by working together we can both be winners thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager put er there pal
ohhh so youre gonna welch on our bet
what are you talking about neither boy lost
i got it right here in writing
the father of the boy who doesnt win has to mow the lawn in his wifes sunday dress
but neither i mean were both i mean you have to do it too
its a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself
oh my best dress
why do i get the feeling that someday ill be describing this to a psychiatrist
listen to em laughing this is so humiliating im never gonna live this down damn flanders
halftime marge halftime
ding-dong
yknow simpson i feel kinda silly but what the hay you know it kinda reminds me of my good ole fraternity days

whatre you talking about bill

bullwinkle
who wait a minute whos that
underdog dont you know anything

maggie im about to unveil my centerpiece to the family
here comes the cavalry
homer you promised to be nice to my sisters

its a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our country great see theres georgia okeefe susan b anthony and this is marjorie stoneman douglas im sure you havent heard of her but she worked her whole life to preserve the florida everglades

yeah but what are ya gonna do
ill tell you what im going to do im going to write a letter

take a letter miss white dear valued viewer thank you for taking an interest in the itchy and scratchy program enclosed is a personally autographed photo of americas favorite cat and mouse team to add to your collection

so much needless brutality i dont know if im having any impact at all
dont do that dont do that hey dont do that
take that you dumb squirrel
mmmmmmmph
where do they get their ideas
what is it what smartline yes ive heard of your late-night panel discussion show well id love to
smartline with our local emmy-award winning host kent brockman
there she is
thank you
hi kent
hiya
me and the guys went fishing almost caught a catfish this big
theres nothing wrong with it
excuse me excuse me he was addressing me
i know theres nothing wrong with it
excuse me there is i think that its a bad influence on children
oh give me a break i think that is a bunch of baloney and heres why in preparing for this debate i did a little research and i discovered a startling thing there was violence in the past long before cartoons were invented
yeah and there was something called the crusades for instance tremendous violence many people killed the darn thing went on for thirty years
thats right kent so much for your viewpoint
ah well kent to me the high jinks - of a few comic characters absolutely pale in comparison with the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into every day im im referring here to women who love too much fear of winning sexaholism stuff like that
no not at all in fact one of my guilty little pleasures is to snuggle up with a big bucket of buttered popcorn dim the lights turn on itchy scratchy and laugh myself silly and what the hell is wrong with that
hi kids
oh im sorry kent its just that when the camera gets on me hey hey
oh
ohhh
yes id like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel thank you
i dont believe this i will never watch your show buy any of your products or brake if i see you crossing the street wow thats cold
dear sleaze merchant -- now come on that hurts
gentlemen the screwballs have spoken
hello
is this marge simpson
yes
the marge simpson who fixed it so cartoons cant be violent anymore
yes
this is myers im here with the writers listen youre so smart how do we end this picture
well whats the problem youre having
okay here it is itchy just stole scratchys ice cream cone
make it a pie pies are easier to draw
okay a pie anyway scratchy is understandably upset
huh huh
so we figured he could - you know - just grab itchy and toss him in a bucket of acid
oh dear
but then we remembered that this might be interpreted as violence which is morally wrong now thanks to you so whats your big idea how do we end this
well lets see oh couldnt itchy share his pie with scratchy then they would both have pie
its different ill give you that
its a tool that every home handyman needs its a jigsaw its a power drill its a wood-turning lathe
borrowed
its an asphalt spreader its sixty- seven tools in one how much would you pay for a machine that can do all this
one thousand dollars
dont answer yet
oh sorry
because you also get
i was watching that
its time for krusty
you mean we can watch cartoons again mom
yes dear all you want
all right
turn it up
hey kids its time for itchy scratchy
they love they share they share and love and share love love love share share share the itchy scratchy showwww
lemonade
please
i made it just for you
you are my best friend
itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge
i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing
i think it sucks
oh hey thank you maggie
mmmm this really hits the spot
doesnt it though
you really make good lemonade scratchy
oh oh oh thank you itchy
wasnt that funny boys and girls well wasnt it

good question
well i guess i cant which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons
oh yeah well what do you have to say to all those marge simpson wannabes out there who wish to suppress davids doodle

well there he is michelangelos dave

oh dr hibbert from johns hopkins medical school
with all due respect mrs simpson you are not a doctor the boys not a doctor im not a doctor the only person in this room who even comes close is this man

doctor are you sure there isnt a little soft tissue trauma in the facial area
oh yeah tons of it just say when
a million dollars smithers i want this homer j simpson fired
uh do you think thats wise mr burns i mean think of the headlines
what about the headlines
the press might be critical of you for firing the crippled boys father so soon after the accident
thank you your honor now bart i want you to tell the jury in your own words exactly what happened on the day of the accident
just give me a ticket
well all right then i dont want to seem like an ogre ill bide my time let him twist in the wind slowly slowly and then when the papers have found their new flavor of the month hell find out this cat has claws
good thinking sir
now lets pretend youre on the witness stand how are you bart
fine
oh fine isnt that nice bart says hes fine wrong you are not fine you are in constant pain
i am in constant pain
dad may i please make an observation
oh what what is it
i think this is all a charade to make bart look more injured than he really is
well maybe lisa does have a point i dont mind you boys doing this in the living room but in court doesnt bart have to tell the truth
yeah but what is truth -- if you follow me now bart can you roll your eyes back in your head like this
ah you mean like im dead yeah sure
the kids a pro
springfield municipal court is now in session judge moulton presiding
your honor my client has instructed me to remind the court how rich and important he is and that he is not like other men
i should be able to run over as many kids as i want
mr burns i must warn you that if you continue to disrupt the court in this way i will have to cite you for contempt
you wouldnt dare
well no i-i guess i wouldnt
calling bartholomew j simpson to the stand
oh please
hello bart now you know the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie dont you son
maybe
uh-huh well you wouldnt lie to the united states would you bart
no
yes sir it was a beautiful sunday afternoon i was playing in my wholesome childlike way little realizing that i was about to be struck down by the luxury car of death
defenseless child at three oclock
luckily i was not killed that day although sometimes i wish i had been
hes lying
now thats believable testimony
now mr burns would you please relate in your own words exactly what really happened on the day of the accident
certainly oh it was a beautiful day the sun was shining i was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys
suddenly that incorrigible simpson boy darted in front of me
oh my goodness look whats happened
oh its not important sir lets drive on
why you despicable cold-blooded monster regardless of what you think we must summon help and comfort the dear boy until an ambulance arrives
noooo take me im old
and thats what happened
what are you looking at me like that for you believed his cock and bull story
its looking good mr simpson its looking very very good
they hate me well what trial were you watching
oh yeah settlement fine hang your heads in shame you over-priced under-brained glorified notary publics just get that big ape to my house tonight and well buy him off with a banana or two
and that ugly customer was the last indonesian rhino on earth
i didnt know you liked animals
oh i dont like everything about them just their heads well would you care for some wine old buddy
dont mind if i do
bottoms up simpson theres plenty more where that came from
mr burns are you trying to get me drunk
yes now then homer old chum im sure youll agree with me that this trial is an affront to our collective dignity what do you say we settle this man to man
you mean duke it out
oh no i mean im prepared to offer you a most generous cash settlement
a princely sum
well a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all
five hundred thousand dollars
goodness
up-up-up-up dont answer me now relax talk it over with the missus soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be smithers lets go powder my nose
well marge what do you think
i dont know maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us
the fish is in the pan
what do you think homer
ill tell you what i think i think he thinks im an idiot the only reason hes offering us this is because he knows hes gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million
oh i feel faint
five hundred thousand dollars i spit on his five hundred thousand dollars
homer whats happened to you all this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --
phony doctors hel-lo
do you know what id settle for if it was up to me barts medical bills and an apology
you better be dyin
and you wont even get that
sorry offers expired i guess well just have to let the jury decide twelve good men and true good day smithers release the hounds
your honor i would like to call to the stand mrs homer j simpson
do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
yes i do
she sounded like she was taking that awful seriously
oh the truth
mrs simpson does the name julius hibbert mean anything to you
yes hes been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother hes seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care
but wait a minute im confused this court heard expert testimony from one dr nick riviera what is your opinion of him
mrs simpson
im sorry but my mother always said if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
will that hold up in court
no ive tried it before
mrs simpson what is your opinion of dr riviera and let me remind you that youre under oath
well to be honest he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better and he mispronounced words that even i know like abdomen and his office was dirty now that i think about it im not sure hes even a doctor
and mrs simpson could you describe for us in your own words barts intense mental anguish and suffering
well i dont know how intense it was
huh uh
but well i guess he did miss three days of school --
oh three days
although he doesnt really like school all that much
so i guess that may not count as anguish
no it doesnt
it was a little hard on me having him around the house
yes
all that time
could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships
well we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash
huh uh
i suppose if hed been able to do it that week we might have given him the five dollars
five dollars
um-hmm
but your lawyer -- assuming he is a lawyer -- is asking for a million well we cant blame them for trying can we thank you very much mrs simpson
oh marge
im going to write a figure on this piece of paper its not quite as large as the last one but i think youll find it fair
i think we should take it
a million dollars my wife cost me a million dollars
homer would you like some more macaroni and cheese
yeah a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman no thank you
some string beans
no i dont want any string beans either you two-timing back-stabbing uh oh i better answer no thank you
some celery with cream cheese on it
no thank you
you know what wouldve really been cool if we got that million bucks
bart please
what we could have bought tons of great stuff mom maids a pool fancy sweaters stop me if im wrong
marge dear would it be all right if i went over to moes for a drink
sure
i dont know if ill ever come back here goodnight
my womans intuition is telling me something i wonder what oh my god
well thats it i guess this is the class im gonna die in
eh youre better off rich people arent happy from the day theyre born to the day they die they think theyre happy but trust me they aint
moe i wish hed shut up
look a chick
and its not even ladies night
hey hey guys knock it off its just my wife
my name is marge
homer id like you to forgive me for doing the right thing
oh marge
weve squabbled over money before -- never this much -- i mean i know this is different than that time i washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket but i--
no no no you think this is about money well its not its worse marge im afraid that from now on when i look at you im not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children im just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance
what are you saying homer
im saying shes been your wife for ten years youve had three children together its time to be honest with her im not sure i love you anymore
but dont worry ill never let on ill still do all the bed stuff maybe it wont be so bad

bargaining

marge this may not be the most appropriate forum for what i am about to put forth but would you go to the prom with me
i can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments now the first is from time magazine dated january 8 1974 americas love affair with the prom even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year
no artie artie the best argument is that ive known and respected you for eight years and i would be delighted to go to the prom with you

patty selma were home
ill tell you one thing greasy joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me
marge i need to speak with you alone
oh and that sauce barney i could have drunk a bowl of it by itself no barney thats just my sister-in-law

well ill try
homer do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the bowlers hall of fame in st louis missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin

to be called up whenever and for whatever reason i desire
but that was just an idle promise
not to me
i want you to find a husband for my sister selma
find a husband which ones selma again
shes the one who likes police academy movies and hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days
oh yeah yeah yeah but i thought she didnt like to be you know touched

but marge
homer you will find her a man

ladies and gentlemen
most of you already know that with a little love and compassion any puppy will grow up to be a cuddly little bundle of joy stuff and nonsense taught by charlatans and learned by bloody twits let me tell you the two most important words you will ever hear in your life choke chain
you raise a dog the same way you would raise a child with simple authoritative commands lay down
followed by immediate correction
how can we tell if were doing this maneuver effectively
the dogs eyes will cross and his tongue will protrude and change color ever so slightly
is my dog dead maam
you dont know how often im asked that choke chain is a misnomer trust me they are always breathing
jack i think the baby might be yours
oh im sure it is doll-face but id like to see you prove it
youre treating me like garbage
thats because thats the way you love it baby
gee is it always this good
oh i dont know i just dip in and out im only watching today because brandy is coming out of her coma and she knows the phony princes body is hidden in the boathouse
ohh that dog
bad dog dont worry snowball youre safe with me
mom what will we do if santas little helper doesnt learn anything in obedience school
i dont know
father mcgrath i thought you were dead
i was
there are two ways for a dog to relieve himself one is like a faithful friend and partner for life the other is like a hose without a fireman which way do you think that was mr simpson

look mom i finished my patch it depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life
miss winthrop i was thinking
on the left is mr largo my music teacher at school he taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul and on the right is bleeding gums murphy he taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth so you better stick an instrument in front of it
hm
and look
come on homer i want you to see what your sick little girl did
my quilt six generations gone
now marge honey honey honey come on come on dont get upset its not the end of the world we all loved that quilt but you cant get too attached to

homer what are you saying
im saying
no way you cant give my dog away ill set fire to my hair ill rip up all my clothes ill put sugar in the gas tank
bart
ive suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog but when i look into his vacant brown eyes i just cant bear to let him go im sure mom agrees with me
no im afraid i agree with your father
you do ha ha ha ha ha
homer please its not just the quilt hes a nice dog but he chews up everything he doesnt obey hes not even housebroken and weve spent all this money on an obedience school and i dont see any improvement
all right all right if santas little helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog can we keep him then
no
dad
tch tch oh dear
since you get paid either way would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass
dad this is our pet we can question his integrity and disposition but we cant question his heart are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away
oh lisa if theyre ever going to pull the plug on me i want you in my corner honey
oh all right if he passes obedience school we can keep him
yea
all right
see boy its not so hard here roll over roll over like this
congratulations sonny youve earned a toffee

mom these are really good while i know first-hand how fragile young talent is id love to hear the particulars of how your gift was squashed
well
no not another portrait of that bongo-beating liverpudlian
but mr schindler
someone might have used this canvas to create a masterpiece instead youve soiled it forever
now this is art
thank you mr schindler
oh mom i cant believe you gave up painting because of one small-minded art teacher
i was so upset i decided to send the portrait to the only man on earth whose opinion i could truly trust
and what was ringos response
i never got any and i never painted again
maybe you could take a class at springfield community college
i think its a very nice idea dont you homer
do i have to do anything
no
great fine go nuts
mmm only thirty-five calories
hello mrs homer
apu what are you doing here
ive just enrolled in a screenwriting class i yearn to tell the story of an idealistic young hindu pushed too far by convenience store bandits i call it hands off my jerky turkey
clever title
oh thank you actually my brother sanjay thought of it
next up
my mother would like to enroll in painting from life 2-b
whoa whoa whoa whoa not so fast there pint size im afraid no one can enroll until professor lombardo personally inspects and approves their portfolio
oh lisa this was a bad idea
mom
very good fabulous ooh even better you have real talent
do you really think so my high school art teacher hated them
what the man was a fool but still one must admire the force of his conviction
then im in the class
oh my dear there couldnt be a class without you now if youll excuse me nature calls
marvelous
the heavy hands dont work unless you move homer
i cant move boy
oh really
now using the lombardo method you learn to see everyday objects as a simple grouping of geometrical shapes
smithers find me an artist
here we see how two concentric circles various trapezoids ellipses and yes even a rhombus can create an adorable little bunny rabbit
its just that easy
lincoln lincoln i been thinkin what the hell have you been drinkin is it water is it wine oh my god its turpentine faster faster
bravo walk away from it now it belongs to the ages you not another stroke oh well maybe one more thats it perfect

im sorry but this isnt working out i quit
well smithers i guess thats what you call your artistic temperament
sir i must remind you that the dedication of the burns wing of the museum is only six days away
damnation smithers this idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait was as half-baked as your idea about me having children
okay shoot
sir im afraid youve systematically alienated springfields entire art community the only one left is this mrs homer simpson
who
well she won first prize in the springfield art fair and as the wife of an employee shell be easily intimidated
excellent once again the wheel has turned and dame fortune has hugged montgomery burns to her sweet perfumed bosom somebody up there likes me smithers

beatles eh oh yes i seem to remember their off-key caterwauling on the old sullivan show what was he thinking mrs simpson this commission and all its glory can be yours but first you must look me straight in the eye and answer one simple question
can you make me beautiful
i dont think that will be a problem
im no matinee idol
well maybe not but i have the gift of being able to see inner beauty
hmmm mrs simpson you may immortalize me

umm hello my name is marge simpson and i painted this maybe youd like to know what possessed me to do it well i guess i wanted to show that beneath mr burns fearsome head with its cruel lips spiteful tongue and evil brain there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of gods creatures
provocative but powerful

excellent excellent martin
if youre through with your pemmican why dont we sing a song about cowboys now this ones not very accurate but we can fix it up as we go along okay
home home on the range actually the range was far from home it was a very desolate place where danger and disease rode tall in the saddle where the deer and the antelope play unlike the efficient indians cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope and they threw the rest away
where seldom is heard a discouraging word and the skies are not cloudy all day
hey whats this did you do it
no no it wasnt me i would never do anything like that it was just one of those immature people who instead of building themselves up --
its neat can i have it
