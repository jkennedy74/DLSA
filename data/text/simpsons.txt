i slaved in the kitchen for days for you people and
well if you wanted to make serak the preparer cry mission accomplished
you arent the only beings who have emotions you know
we offered you paradise you would have experienced emotions a hundred times greater than what you call love and a thousand times greater than what you call fun you would have been treated like gods and lived forever in beauty but now because of your distrustful nature that can never be
for a superior race they really rub it in
there were monsters on that ship and truly we were them
lisa see what we mean when we say youre too smart for your own good
way to go lis
yeah thanks lisa
hello something scary happening
hey poindexter its halloween put the book away
for your information im about to read you a classic tale of terror by edgar allan poe
wait a minute thats a schoolbook
dont worry bart you wont learn anything
its called the raven
once upon a midnight dreary
while i pondered weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
huh
like what
as of someone gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
tis some visitor
i muttered
#NAME?
are we scared yet
bart hes establishing mood
ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow -- vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow
-- sorrow for the lost lenore --
oh lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore -- nameless here for evermore
aag
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- this it is and nothing more
presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
sir --
-- said i --
#NAME?
here i opened wide the door --
this better be good
darkness there and nothing more
you know what would have been scarier than nothing
what
anything
back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before
surely --
-- said i --
-- surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore --
mr burns in twenty years i have never seen such a shoddy deplorable --
open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door -- perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door -- perched and sat and nothing more
though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou --
i said --
#NAME?
quoth the raven
eat my shorts
bart stop it he says nevermore thats all hell ever say
okay okay
then methought the air grew denser perfumed by some unseen censer
ouch censer
swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor
wretch --
i cried --
#NAME?
quoth the raven
nevermore
be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend
i shrieked of starting
get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore oh leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken -- quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven
nevermore
take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven
nevermore
why you little --
uh-oh
come back here now raven
nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore nevermore
and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted -- nevermore
lisa that wasnt scary not even for a poem
well it was written in 1845 maybe people were easier to scare back then
well yeah like when you look at friday the 13th part i its pretty tame by todays standards
children bedtime
i guess ill have no trouble gettin to sleep tonight
oh no marge come on please
homer i am not sleeping with the lights on theyre just childrens stories they cant hurt you
oh oh i hate halloween
so kids caught anything

im dave shutton im an investigative reporter whos on the road a lot and uh i must say that in my day we didnt talk that way to our elders
well this is my day and we do sir

monitoring station unmanned
look here inspector could i speak to you privately i-in my office
oh look some careless person has left thousands and thousands of dollars just lying here on my coffee table uh smithers why dont we leave the room and hopefully when we return the pile of money will be gone
look smithers the money and a very stupid man are still here
burns if i didnt know better id think you were trying to bribe me
is there some confusion about this
take it take it take it you poor schmoe
mr burns i am going to overlook this felony however i will not overlook the three hundred and forty-two violations i have observed at your plant today either bring this place up to code or well shut it down good-day
oh well a little dab of paint here a little spackle there how much could it possibly cost to fix this place up
hmmm approximately fifty-six million dollars sir
fifty-six million

ooooh cushy
homer theyre trying to shut us down
they say were contaminating the planet
well nobodys perfect
why cant the government just get off our backs
you know i was just telling the wife that if i was governor id do things a lot differently
oh get off your soapbox simpson do you realize how much it costs to run for office more than any honest man can afford
i bet you could afford it though
uh dont get me wrong i mean youre an honest man i just meant that you could afford to run for governor if you felt like it course im just rambling because uh because you keep staring at me like that but but its true i mean if you were governor you could decide whats safe and what isnt
where are we going sir
to create a new and better world
if its on the way could you drop me off at my house
well hes got my vote
homer were a mary bailey family
mary bailey isnt going to fire me if i dont vote for her im for monty burns
oooo a political discussion at our table i feel like a kennedy
well frankly i dont see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against mary bailey the most beloved governor our great state has ever known
now heres the problem as i see it while governor bailey is beloved by all ninety-eight percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse thats why weve assembled the finest campaign team money can buy this is your speech writer
huh uh
your joke writer
huh uh
your spin doctor
huh uh
your make-up man
yeah
and your personal trainer
oooo
their job to turn this mr burns
into this
why are my teeth showing like that
because youre smiling
ah excellent this is exactly the kind of trickery im paying you for but but how do we turn your average joe sixpack against mary bailey
with this team of investigators your muckraker
how do you do
your character assassin
nice to meet you
your mudslinger
ah
your garbologist
hello
their job is to turn mary bailey from thisinto this
visual aids help so much thank you
but first theres a burning issue that we need to address and neutralize immediately
i hate that fish
thank you for watching movie for a dreary afternoon please stay tuned for a paid political announcement brought to you by the friends of montgomery burns
burns change the channel
you change it
no you change it
i changed it last week
fine be a jerk then well just sit here and watch it
oh no an election thats one of those deals where they close the bars isnt it
sorry barney
i wonder if hes going to say anything about that horrible fish
oh marge whats the big deal i bet before the papers blew this out of proportion you didnt even know how many eyes a fish had
thirty seconds to air mr burns
now remember to smile
i am smiling
youll have to do better than that
hows this
there you go
im going to be sore tomorrow
well weve done all we can mr burns the rest is up to you
oh dont worry --
#NAME?
oh hello friends im montgomery burns your next governor and im here to talk to you about my little friend here blinky
many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation nothing could be further from the truth but dont take my word for it lets ask an actor portraying charles darwin what he thinks
hello mr burns
oh hello charles be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection
glad to mr burns you see every so often mother nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth sharper claws longer legs or in this case a third eye and if these variations turn out to be an improvement the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the face of the earth
so youre saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish it may in fact be a kind of super fish
i wouldnt mind having a third eye would you
no you see friends if our anti-nuclear naysayers and choose-up-siders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant theyd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman
the truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that cant be beat mmmm mmmm so to summarize say what you want about me i can take the slings and arrows but stop slandering poor defenseless blinky good night and god bless
only a moron wouldnt cast his votefor monty burns
wow super fish
i wish the government would get off his back
that burns is just what this state needs young blood
i hope burns and i can count on your support honey
homer im a bailey booster
oh yeah well im a burns booster ow
congratulations mr burns the latest polls show youre up six points
giving me a total of
six but were on our way
my worthy opponent seems to think that the voters of this state are gullible fools i however prefer to rely on their intelligence and good judgment
and i say taxes are too high
have you found any dirt on mary bailey
well weve gone through her garbage
weve talked to her maid
and so far the only negative thing we have found is from some guy who dated her when she was sixteen
ah and
he felt her up
bah not good enough
were gonna send - a message - to those bureaucrats - down there in the state capital
is your boss governor yet
not yet son not yet
the voters now see you as imperial and god-like
hot dog
but theres a downside to it the latest polls indicate youre in danger of losing touch with the common man
oh dear heaven forefend
which is why the night before the election we want you to have dinner at the home of one of your workers
oh i get your angle every joe meatball and sally housecoat in this god-forsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with eddie punchclock the media will have a field day
the only question is -- can we find someone common enough
well i i knew there would be sacrifices
ah great toast marge hmmm oh by the way the night before the election mr burns is coming over for dinner
what
and some reporters and camera crews but you dont need to feed them
cool man a media circus
absolutely not
come on marge
huh uh im going to be ringing doorbells for mary bailey that night
kids please leave the room i dont want you to see this
uh oh
please please please please please please please please please please
were hoping that one of the children might pop up with a question about the upcoming election little girl do you think you can memorize this by dinner time tomorrow
mr burns your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train why are you so popular
very good
hmmm well as long as im asking something can i ask him to assuage my fears that hes contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable
no dear the card question will be fine
well i think the non-card question is a valid one
marge dont worry my daughters very bright im sure shell be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow
only an innocent child could get away with such blasphemy god bless them all amen
and finally mr burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him but we must remind you he hates being touched
marge get back in bed
no im just fine right here
whats wrong i just want to snuggle
well i dont feel like snuggling
whats that got to do with it
i dont want to snuggle with anybody whos not letting me express myself
but you do get to express yourself in the lovely home you keep and the food you serve
okay homer fair enough you got it all right good thats it thats how im gonna express myself thats right goodnight
huh
well what do we think
hey hello handsome
hey get that stuff off his face were here to have dinner with the common man not tyrone power
the latest polls are in its dead even -- fifty-fifty this cornball stunt is gonna put us over the top
whoa hes here
hello homer marge you look dazzling oh and look ive brought noodle kugel
bad dog bad neighbor dog here let me help you up mr burns
i love dogs babies too
aaaah kitty kitty
are you all right mr burns
oh of course a little roughhousing with the pets is good for a mans appetite
the latest polls are in the statesman-like way you handled the pet incident has put you over the top youre ahead fifty-one to forty-nine congratulations mr governor
excellent
bart would you like to say grace
dear god we paid for all this stuff ourselves so thanks for nothin
hes smokin hes smokin
you know mr burns my family and i feel that taxes are too high where do you stand on this highly controversial issue
goodness i didnt realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate
i was only reading what the card
homer i agree with you and if im elected governor i will lower taxes whether those bureaucrats in the state capital like it or not
lisa do you have a question you would like to ask your uncle montgomery
yes sir a very inane one mr burns your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train why are you so popular
oooh a tough question but a fair one lisa theres no single answer some voters respond to my integrity others are more impressed with my incorruptibility still others by my determination to lower taxes and the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it
oh mom that felt awful
im sorry dear it will all be over soon
but mom weve become the tools of evil
lisa youre learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt
some cant even get a fair shake or even a square deal ummmm smells delightful
all right three eyed fish
can i have your plate mr burns
ruined before it hit the ground
get me the city desk
heres your headline phil burns cant swallow own story
the latest polls indicate burns popularity has plummeted to earth like so much half-chewed fish

wait come back you cant do this to me im charles montgomery burns
smithers tip over this table for me

uh oh youre busted dad
oh my dreams will go unfulfilled oh no i dont like the sound of that one bit that means i have nothing to hope for marge make it better please cant you make it better huh

lisa honey youre forgetting the beer it comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here
i hope youll space out the tubs this year homer

swung on and belted to deep left field its going going
its gone its outta here oh my god the isotopes win a game the isotopes win a game the isotopes win a game

i thank you youre too kind glad you enjoyed it but i cant take all the credit the batter did his part too
excuse me you sir -- the dancing fella im antoine tex ohara i own the isotopes would you be interested in becoming our official mascot
m-- me a mascot for a bush league team
i should have slept on it or at least stared blankly for a while perhaps if id been unable to think of a nickname all our lives might have been spared
well im ready to punch in
oh oh hey cool man
our lives have taken an odd turn
did the team ask you to dress like that homer
nope this was my own bright idea cmon we gotta hurry dont fill up on those vegetables kids save room for your nachos

homer im not firing you i just got the word -- youve been called up to capital city
me in the majors
thats right
wait a minute capital city has a mascot the greatest mascot there is the capital city goofball
yeah but hes getting on in years and he needs someone to fill in for a couple of innings a night could be a big opportunity for you
ill say
why dont you talk it over with your family
because they might say no
this was the biggest decision the simpsons ever faced i shouldve listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife
i shouldnt have called her that bite my tongue bite my tongue oooh
i cant leave springfield i was born here and i thought i would die here
it wont be so bad youll die someplace else
well what am i supposed to do about friends
phfft youll make new and better friends
but dad were simple people with simple values capital city is too big and too complex everyone in springfield knows us and has forgiven us
homer id be lying if i didnt say that this scares me a little but we all have a calling a reason the almighty put us on this earth and yours might be to dance on dugouts
you mean --
lets do it homer
yeah lets blow this pop stand and never look back
whatever doesnt kill me can only make me stronger
its not that simple ive got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence
sure what would you like -- four years five years
so simpson youre really moving to capital city
thats right ned
uh huh and all this stuff is for sale huh you know i-i-i dont know how to say this but well

well we have one quick stop and then its on to capital city
i cant believe it our baby sister in the big city
ill call you every day
ill call you too
look he can use a horn
oh shut up
some may say that i have been given a bad break in life -- little education bald as a cue ball ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today as i leave for capital city i consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the earth
with the fickle fans already forgetting me i was ready to take the biggest step of my life

actually this section is for the players ex-wives
and then i found out that all the while there was this bimbo in kansas city
throw at his head
whodve thought it a free ticket to a big league park but i was too tense to enjoy the game every ounce of concentration i possessed was focused on the task at hand
red hots get your read hots here

oh well huh it went in
good shot toddsky

final score bart forty-one homer lets see six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six
never mind

whos charlene
ill show you who charlene is now start hating
hi bart
homer i couldnt help overhearing you warp barts mind
and
well im worried that youre making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament
but marge this is our big chance to show up the flanderses
well im sure it is but why do we want to do that
because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad and im tired of making other people feel good about themselves
hi bart whatre you doing
lis what do you call those guys in chess that dont matter
absolutely eeeeeeeer
well a blockaded bishop is of little value but i think youre referring to a pawn
right i am a pawn
i know its times like this that im thankful dad has little to no interest in almost everything i do bart i think i can help you
our journey begins here at the library
hi lisa
hi mrs norton
hi lisa
hi ralph
hi lisa
hey gang okay bart this is the card catalog
lets see golf anecdotes eisenhower and fashion humor japanese obsession with ah here it is putting
and finally the most important book of all the tao te ching by lao tzu
lisa we cant afford all these books
bart were just gonna borrow them
oh heh heh gotcha
i want you to shut off the logical part of your mind
okay
embrace nothingness
you got it
become like an uncarved stone
done
bart youre just pretending to know what im talking about
TRUE
well its very frustrating
ill bet
bart i have a riddle for you whats the sound of one hand clapping
piece of cake
no bart its a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer its supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought
no answer lisa listen up
lets try another one if a tree falls in the woods and no ones around does it make a sound
i said now
but bart how can a sound exist if theres no one there to hear it
woooooooo
it is time
the basis of this game seems to be simple geometry all you have to do is hit the ball here
i cant believe it youve actually found a practical use for geometry
bart whatre you doing get down from there before the neighbors see --
hey simpson
flanders i dont care what this looks like barts gonna mop the floor with your sons ugly butt
well sir may the best man win
ah may the best man win the mating call of the loser
now just a minute simpson i think my son has a very good chance
oh yeah wanna bet
yeah well im not a betting man
oh im a chicken am i
thats right
all right hows this for a wager a batch of your wifes delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wifes homemade wind chimes
what are you afraid to make a real bet
no i just --
you know simpson youre starting to annoy me
how about this henny penny if bart wins tomorrow you have to mow my lawn
all right and if todd wins you have to mow my lawn and do a decent job of it for a change
better yet you have to mow my lawn in your wifes sunday dress
you have yourself a bet you jackaninny
read that back to me marge
the father of the loser mows the lawn --
eh eh just a minute loser is such a harsh word couldnt we just say the boy who doesnt win
oh man fine
the father of the boy who doesnt win has to mow the lawn in his wifes sunday dress
there you go
now i suppose you both have to sign this i hope blood wont be necessary
im game if you are flanders
good gravy what have i done
keep your left arm straight bart rotate your shoulders
dad
look son all im asking is that you try
okay ill try
anybody can try i want you to win
homer
marge give me your honest opinion this or this
good morning son oh by the way todays the day of the big tournament and youd better win
dad
see you downstairs boy
heh heh that crazy marmaduke
eighth hole
aim for the octopus third tentacle
twelfth hole
bank it off the pink tombstone
nirvana
a state of bliss attained through the extinction of the self
here you go bart a lumberjacks breakfast for my little golfer
mom bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates steak will make him logy
ohhh well what wont make him logy
oatmeal
oatmeal
oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the kentucky derby
news flash lisa bart is not a horse eat your steak boy
mom do i have to
good afternoon everybody and welcome to the finale of what has already been a stirring afternoon of miniature golf the cream has risen the wheat has bid farewell to the chaff and now we approach the championship match with but two warriors remaining the heretofore unknown bart simpson and todd flanders one of the most skilled ten-year-olds to ever take back the blade
bart having never received any words of encouragement myself im not sure how theyre supposed to sound but here goes i believe in you
thanks man
hey flanders its no use praying i already did the same thing and we cant both win
actually simpson we were praying that no one gets hurt
oh well flan-ders it doesnt matter this time tomorrow youll be wearing high heels
no you will
fraid not
fraid so
fraid not
fraid so
fraid not infinity
fraid so infinity plus one
young flanders has the honor and will tee off first
its got a chance yes sir
oh man
tree falling in the woods tree falling in the woods tree falling in
and the battle is well and truly joined
woo-hoo-hoo
mercy is for the weak todd
if one were to look up courage in the oxford english dictionary one might very well come upon a photo of these two gladiators they approach the final hole in the shadow of the great emancipator deadlocked at eight strokes on the happy side of par soon one man will emerge triumphant he will drink naught but champagne while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in this oft cruel game
its okay son you can recover
come on bart remember what vince lombardi said if you lose youre out of the family
homer
ow
neither man showing his best form this sort of pressure can unhinge even the steeliest of competitors
this is pretty tense isnt it todd
yeah my knees are shaking ive got butterflies in my stomach but i guess this builds character
who wants to build character lets quit
okay
we decided were equally good
we want to call it a draw man
ladies and gentlemen we have a draw
you will forgive an old brit for crying but this is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since mountbatten gave india back to the punjabs
put her there man
yeah all right
well homer our kids showed us something today huh by working together we can both be winners thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager put er there pal
ohhh so youre gonna welch on our bet
what are you talking about neither boy lost
i got it right here in writing
the father of the boy who doesnt win has to mow the lawn in his wifes sunday dress
but neither i mean were both i mean you have to do it too
its a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself
oh my best dress
why do i get the feeling that someday ill be describing this to a psychiatrist
listen to em laughing this is so humiliating im never gonna live this down damn flanders
halftime marge halftime
ding-dong
yknow simpson i feel kinda silly but what the hay you know it kinda reminds me of my good ole fraternity days
oh my god hes enjoying it

boy now i know how the pilgrims felt
whatre you talking about bill
who the hell is that
bullwinkle
who wait a minute whos that
underdog dont you know anything
well i know it wouldnt hurt em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years
son this is a tradition if you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character youd turn the parade into a farce
maggie im about to unveil my centerpiece to the family
here comes the cavalry
homer you promised to be nice to my sisters
i know i will
its a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our country great see theres georgia okeefe susan b anthony and this is marjorie stoneman douglas im sure you havent heard of her but she worked her whole life to preserve the florida everglades

what kind of warped human being would find that funny
heh heh heh
this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers
yeah but what are ya gonna do
ill tell you what im going to do im going to write a letter
dear purveyors of senseless violence i know this may sound silly at first
but i believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way
eh
please try to tone down the psychotic violence
no
in your otherwise fine programming yours truly marge simpson
take a letter miss white dear valued viewer thank you for taking an interest in the itchy and scratchy program enclosed is a personally autographed photo of americas favorite cat and mouse team to add to your collection
in regards to your specific comments about the show our research indicates that one person cannot make a difference no matter how big a screwball she is so let me close by saying
and the horse i rode in on
everybodys looking at us marge
well thats what we want them to do homer
oh well how long are we going to have to be doing this

so much needless brutality i dont know if im having any impact at all
dont do that dont do that hey dont do that
take that you dumb squirrel
mmmmmmmph
where do they get their ideas
what is it what smartline yes ive heard of your late-night panel discussion show well id love to
smartline with our local emmy-award winning host kent brockman
there she is
thank you
hi kent
hiya
me and the guys went fishing almost caught a catfish this big
theres nothing wrong with it
excuse me excuse me he was addressing me
i know theres nothing wrong with it
excuse me there is i think that its a bad influence on children
oh give me a break i think that is a bunch of baloney and heres why in preparing for this debate i did a little research and i discovered a startling thing there was violence in the past long before cartoons were invented
yeah and there was something called the crusades for instance tremendous violence many people killed the darn thing went on for thirty years
thats right kent so much for your viewpoint
ah well kent to me the high jinks - of a few comic characters absolutely pale in comparison with the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into every day im im referring here to women who love too much fear of winning sexaholism stuff like that
no not at all in fact one of my guilty little pleasures is to snuggle up with a big bucket of buttered popcorn dim the lights turn on itchy scratchy and laugh myself silly and what the hell is wrong with that
hi kids
oh im sorry kent its just that when the camera gets on me hey hey
oh
ohhh
yes id like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel thank you
i dont believe this i will never watch your show buy any of your products or brake if i see you crossing the street wow thats cold
dear sleaze merchant -- now come on that hurts
gentlemen the screwballs have spoken
hello
is this marge simpson
yes
the marge simpson who fixed it so cartoons cant be violent anymore
yes
this is myers im here with the writers listen youre so smart how do we end this picture
well whats the problem youre having
okay here it is itchy just stole scratchys ice cream cone
make it a pie pies are easier to draw
okay a pie anyway scratchy is understandably upset
huh huh
so we figured he could - you know - just grab itchy and toss him in a bucket of acid
oh dear
but then we remembered that this might be interpreted as violence which is morally wrong now thanks to you so whats your big idea how do we end this
well lets see oh couldnt itchy share his pie with scratchy then they would both have pie
its different ill give you that
its a tool that every home handyman needs its a jigsaw its a power drill its a wood-turning lathe
borrowed
its an asphalt spreader its sixty- seven tools in one how much would you pay for a machine that can do all this
one thousand dollars
dont answer yet
oh sorry
because you also get
i was watching that
its time for krusty
you mean we can watch cartoons again mom
yes dear all you want
all right
turn it up
hey kids its time for itchy scratchy
they love they share they share and love and share love love love share share share the itchy scratchy showwww
lemonade
please
i made it just for you
you are my best friend
itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge
i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing
i think it sucks
oh hey thank you maggie
mmmm this really hits the spot
doesnt it though
you really make good lemonade scratchy
oh oh oh thank you itchy
wasnt that funny boys and girls well wasnt it
arent you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons

thats nice dear
come on lis lets go finish our soapbox racers
okay may we please be excused

wow what great kids this is the golden age marge and the parents of springfield owe it all to you
i didnt really expect things to change this much
well i always knew youd change the world for the better
this will be the art event of the century the greatest masterpiece of the italian renaissance michelangelos david on a coast-to-coast tour of the united states

springfield
yes
and if we have time chicago boston and los angeles
marge get the door

hmmm but thats michelangelos david its a masterpiece
its filth it graphically portrays parts of the human body which - practical as they may be are evil
but i like that statue
i told you she was soft on full frontal nudity come on girls
what is all this about what do you people want
we want you to get your big italian butt outta here
smartline with our local emmy-award winning host kent brockman
really great
im not i think everyone in springfield should see it
hmmm yes and no
hold it hold it hold it how can you be for one form of freedom of expression like our big naked friend over there and be against another form like itchy and scratchy
good question
well i guess i cant which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons
oh yeah well what do you have to say to all those marge simpson wannabes out there who wish to suppress davids doodle
um i dont know i guess one person can make a difference but most of the time they probably shouldnt
well i guess that settles that id like to alert our affiliates that we will be ending our show early tonight join us tomorrow when our topic will be religion which is the one true faith
well there he is michelangelos dave
david
oh whats wrong marge
oh homie here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead theyre home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other

oh yeah tons of it just say when

thank you your honor now bart i want you to tell the jury in your own words exactly what happened on the day of the accident
just give me a ticket
well all right then i dont want to seem like an ogre ill bide my time let him twist in the wind slowly slowly and then when the papers have found their new flavor of the month hell find out this cat has claws

springfield municipal court is now in session judge moulton presiding
your honor my client has instructed me to remind the court how rich and important he is and that he is not like other men

mr burns i must warn you that if you continue to disrupt the court in this way i will have to cite you for contempt
you wouldnt dare
well no i-i guess i wouldnt
calling bartholomew j simpson to the stand
oh please
hello bart now you know the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie dont you son

uh-huh well you wouldnt lie to the united states would you bart
no
yes sir it was a beautiful sunday afternoon i was playing in my wholesome childlike way little realizing that i was about to be struck down by the luxury car of death
defenseless child at three oclock
luckily i was not killed that day although sometimes i wish i had been
hes lying
now thats believable testimony
now mr burns would you please relate in your own words exactly what really happened on the day of the accident
certainly oh it was a beautiful day the sun was shining i was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys
suddenly that incorrigible simpson boy darted in front of me
oh my goodness look whats happened
oh its not important sir lets drive on
why you despicable cold-blooded monster regardless of what you think we must summon help and comfort the dear boy until an ambulance arrives
noooo take me im old
and thats what happened
what are you looking at me like that for you believed his cock and bull story
its looking good mr simpson its looking very very good
they hate me well what trial were you watching
oh yeah settlement fine hang your heads in shame you over-priced under-brained glorified notary publics just get that big ape to my house tonight and well buy him off with a banana or two
and that ugly customer was the last indonesian rhino on earth
i didnt know you liked animals
oh i dont like everything about them just their heads well would you care for some wine old buddy
dont mind if i do
bottoms up simpson theres plenty more where that came from
mr burns are you trying to get me drunk
yes now then homer old chum im sure youll agree with me that this trial is an affront to our collective dignity what do you say we settle this man to man
you mean duke it out
oh no i mean im prepared to offer you a most generous cash settlement
a princely sum
well a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all
five hundred thousand dollars
goodness
up-up-up-up dont answer me now relax talk it over with the missus soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be smithers lets go powder my nose
well marge what do you think
i dont know maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us
the fish is in the pan
what do you think homer
ill tell you what i think i think he thinks im an idiot the only reason hes offering us this is because he knows hes gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million
oh i feel faint
five hundred thousand dollars i spit on his five hundred thousand dollars
homer whats happened to you all this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --
phony doctors hel-lo
do you know what id settle for if it was up to me barts medical bills and an apology
you better be dyin
and you wont even get that
sorry offers expired i guess well just have to let the jury decide twelve good men and true good day smithers release the hounds
your honor i would like to call to the stand mrs homer j simpson
do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
yes i do
she sounded like she was taking that awful seriously
oh the truth
mrs simpson does the name julius hibbert mean anything to you
yes hes been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother hes seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care
but wait a minute im confused this court heard expert testimony from one dr nick riviera what is your opinion of him
mrs simpson
im sorry but my mother always said if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
will that hold up in court
no ive tried it before
mrs simpson what is your opinion of dr riviera and let me remind you that youre under oath
well to be honest he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better and he mispronounced words that even i know like abdomen and his office was dirty now that i think about it im not sure hes even a doctor
and mrs simpson could you describe for us in your own words barts intense mental anguish and suffering
well i dont know how intense it was
huh uh
but well i guess he did miss three days of school --
oh three days
although he doesnt really like school all that much
so i guess that may not count as anguish
no it doesnt
it was a little hard on me having him around the house
yes
all that time
could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships
well we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash
huh uh
i suppose if hed been able to do it that week we might have given him the five dollars
five dollars
um-hmm
but your lawyer -- assuming he is a lawyer -- is asking for a million well we cant blame them for trying can we thank you very much mrs simpson
oh marge
im going to write a figure on this piece of paper its not quite as large as the last one but i think youll find it fair
i think we should take it
a million dollars my wife cost me a million dollars
homer would you like some more macaroni and cheese
yeah a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman no thank you
some string beans
no i dont want any string beans either you two-timing back-stabbing uh oh i better answer no thank you

marge dear would it be all right if i went over to moes for a drink

twenty-four hours
well twenty-two im sorry i kept you waiting so long
oh marge im gonna die im gonna die
well if theres one consolation its that you will feel no pain at all until some time tomorrow evening when your heart suddenly explodes
now a little death anxiety is normal you can expect to go through five stages the first is denial
no way because im not dying
the second is anger
why you little --
and after that comes fear
whats after fear whats after fear
bargaining
doc you gotta get me out of this ill make it worth your while
finally acceptance
well we all gotta go some time

congratulations artie
marge this may not be the most appropriate forum for what i am about to put forth but would you go to the prom with me
i can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments now the first is from time magazine dated january 8 1974 americas love affair with the prom even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year
no artie artie the best argument is that ive known and respected you for eight years and i would be delighted to go to the prom with you

maybe i dont watch him every minute but what i am sure of is were getting cable for free
well im afraid that is stealing lisa and i think you must do something hmmm

ladies and gentlemen
most of you already know that with a little love and compassion any puppy will grow up to be a cuddly little bundle of joy stuff and nonsense taught by charlatans and learned by bloody twits let me tell you the two most important words you will ever hear in your life choke chain
you raise a dog the same way you would raise a child with simple authoritative commands lay down
followed by immediate correction
how can we tell if were doing this maneuver effectively
the dogs eyes will cross and his tongue will protrude and change color ever so slightly
is my dog dead maam
you dont know how often im asked that choke chain is a misnomer trust me they are always breathing
jack i think the baby might be yours
oh im sure it is doll-face but id like to see you prove it
youre treating me like garbage
thats because thats the way you love it baby
gee is it always this good
oh i dont know i just dip in and out im only watching today because brandy is coming out of her coma and she knows the phony princes body is hidden in the boathouse
ohh that dog
bad dog dont worry snowball youre safe with me
mom what will we do if santas little helper doesnt learn anything in obedience school
i dont know
father mcgrath i thought you were dead

look mom i finished my patch it depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life
miss winthrop i was thinking
on the left is mr largo my music teacher at school he taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul and on the right is bleeding gums murphy he taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth so you better stick an instrument in front of it
hm
and look
come on homer i want you to see what your sick little girl did
my quilt six generations gone
now marge honey honey honey come on come on dont get upset its not the end of the world we all loved that quilt but you cant get too attached to

we never had a problem with a family member we can give away before
homer what are you saying
im saying
no way you cant give my dog away ill set fire to my hair ill rip up all my clothes ill put sugar in the gas tank
bart
ive suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog but when i look into his vacant brown eyes i just cant bear to let him go im sure mom agrees with me
no im afraid i agree with your father
you do ha ha ha ha ha
homer please its not just the quilt hes a nice dog but he chews up everything he doesnt obey hes not even housebroken and weve spent all this money on an obedience school and i dont see any improvement
all right all right if santas little helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog can we keep him then
no
dad
tch tch oh dear
since you get paid either way would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass
dad this is our pet we can question his integrity and disposition but we cant question his heart are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away
oh lisa if theyre ever going to pull the plug on me i want you in my corner honey
oh all right if he passes obedience school we can keep him
yea
all right
see boy its not so hard here roll over roll over like this

likely story

now theyre only thirty-five calories apiece
hello hello hello taste where are you
you can put a little something on top for flavor
hey hey now youre talkin
mom these are really good while i know first-hand how fragile young talent is id love to hear the particulars of how your gift was squashed
well
no not another portrait of that bongo-beating liverpudlian
but mr schindler
someone might have used this canvas to create a masterpiece instead youve soiled it forever
now this is art
thank you mr schindler
oh mom i cant believe you gave up painting because of one small-minded art teacher
i was so upset i decided to send the portrait to the only man on earth whose opinion i could truly trust
and what was ringos response
i never got any and i never painted again
maybe you could take a class at springfield community college
i think its a very nice idea dont you homer
do i have to do anything
no
great fine go nuts
mmm only thirty-five calories
hello mrs homer
apu what are you doing here
ive just enrolled in a screenwriting class i yearn to tell the story of an idealistic young hindu pushed too far by convenience store bandits i call it hands off my jerky turkey
clever title
oh thank you actually my brother sanjay thought of it
next up
my mother would like to enroll in painting from life 2-b
whoa whoa whoa whoa not so fast there pint size im afraid no one can enroll until professor lombardo personally inspects and approves their portfolio
oh lisa this was a bad idea
mom
very good fabulous ooh even better you have real talent
do you really think so my high school art teacher hated them
what the man was a fool but still one must admire the force of his conviction
then im in the class
oh my dear there couldnt be a class without you now if youll excuse me nature calls
marvelous
the heavy hands dont work unless you move homer
i cant move boy
oh really
now using the lombardo method you learn to see everyday objects as a simple grouping of geometrical shapes
smithers find me an artist
here we see how two concentric circles various trapezoids ellipses and yes even a rhombus can create an adorable little bunny rabbit
its just that easy
lincoln lincoln i been thinkin what the hell have you been drinkin is it water is it wine oh my god its turpentine faster faster
bravo walk away from it now it belongs to the ages you not another stroke oh well maybe one more thats it perfect
mmmm indeed marge you find the inner beauty of your subject and bring it out for all to see
well thank you professor lombardo

i cant believe it
yay mom

garbage what matchbook art school did you flunk out of you ham-fisted nearsighted house painter smithers throw this on the dung heap
im sorry but this isnt working out i quit
well smithers i guess thats what you call your artistic temperament
sir i must remind you that the dedication of the burns wing of the museum is only six days away
damnation smithers this idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait was as half-baked as your idea about me having children
okay shoot
sir im afraid youve systematically alienated springfields entire art community the only one left is this mrs homer simpson
who
well she won first prize in the springfield art fair and as the wife of an employee shell be easily intimidated
excellent once again the wheel has turned and dame fortune has hugged montgomery burns to her sweet perfumed bosom somebody up there likes me smithers
somebody down here likes you too sir

he was the drummer for a rock n roll combo called the beatles sir
beatles eh oh yes i seem to remember their off-key caterwauling on the old sullivan show what was he thinking mrs simpson this commission and all its glory can be yours but first you must look me straight in the eye and answer one simple question
can you make me beautiful
i dont think that will be a problem
im no matinee idol
well maybe not but i have the gift of being able to see inner beauty
hmmm mrs simpson you may immortalize me
ah sir at last the world will see you as i always have

umm hello my name is marge simpson and i painted this maybe youd like to know what possessed me to do it well i guess i wanted to show that beneath mr burns fearsome head with its cruel lips spiteful tongue and evil brain there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of gods creatures

excellent excellent martin
if youre through with your pemmican why dont we sing a song about cowboys now this ones not very accurate but we can fix it up as we go along okay
home home on the range actually the range was far from home it was a very desolate place where danger and disease rode tall in the saddle where the deer and the antelope play unlike the efficient indians cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope and they threw the rest away
where seldom is heard a discouraging word and the skies are not cloudy all day
hey whats this did you do it
