Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now amp work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate Dems will join in
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans Most Republicans were loyal terrific amp worked really hard We will return
As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan Stay tuned
With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House amp Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes
The Senate must go to a vote majority instead of current votes Even parts of full Repeal need  Dems control Senate Crazy

My son Donald openly gave his emails to the media amp authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted amp acid washed her emails
In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci he wanted to endorse me st before the Republican Primaries started but didnt think I was running

The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Councils vote in favor of sanctions on N Korea
How much longer will the failing nytimes with its big losses and massive unfunded liability and nonexistent sources remain in business
I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam where he lied about his service so he can at least say he was there

I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI He has pled guilty to those lies It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful There was nothing to hide
 years ago this week a brave seamstress in Montgomery Alabama uttered one word that changed history
Great job First Lady Melania
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording lies many timesand nothing happens to her Rigged system or just a double standard
Many people in our Country are asking what the Justice Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and acid washed Emails No justice
Congratulations to ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt More Networks and papers should do the same with their Fake News
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie
Such a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco
Tainted no very dishonest FBI agents role in Clinton probe under review Led Clinton Email probe foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge
After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation and more running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters worst in History But fear not we will bring it back to greatness
People who lost money when the Stock Market went down points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of ABC News he has been suspended should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused many millions of dollars

The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a year low So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration perhaps more than any other President in first year Sadly will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media
Remember the Republicans are in Congressional races this year In Senate I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange and Roy lost Virginia candidate was not a Trumper and he lost Good Republican candidates will win BIG
FoxNewsFBIs Andrew McCabe in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M Clinton Puppet he was using allegedly his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign You obviously cannot do this These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton
The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News Despite only negative reporting we are doing well nobody is going to beat us MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

While the Fake News loves to talk about my socalled low approval rating foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec  was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec  which was and this despite massive negative Trump coverage amp Russia hoax
Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer Should be charging MUCH MORE
The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration amp ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc We must protect our Country at all cost

Thank you GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy Couldnt agree wyou more TOGETHER we are MAGA
ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers on behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for what you are doing to keep fellow Americans SAFE Everyone is so gratefulLawEnforcementAppreciationDayPresident realDonaldTrump
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case such as DACA always runs to the th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between TrumpRussia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace Must have tough Primary
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion amp yet on and on it goes Russia amp the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing Republicans should finally take control
I want to thank my Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead Together we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Disproven and paid for by Democrats Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election foxandfriends Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers Where are Crooked Hillary Emails What a mess
In new Quinnipiac Poll of people feel the economy is Excellent or Good That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll
House votes on controversial FISA ACT today This is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others
 year low in illegal immigration this year foxandfriends
With that being said I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and todays vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land We need it Get smart
Great news as a result of our TAX CUTS amp JOBS ACT
Yesterday I signed the INTERDICTAct HR with bipartisan members of Congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country Together we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the United States

More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than BILLION in Michigan plant relocating their heavytruck production from Mexico to Michigan adding new jobs and paying bonus to US employees
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for TrumpPence Plenty of more to follow
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold a first
The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery amp Chain USA
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for billion dollars Bad deal Wanted me to cut ribbonNO
The socalled bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards Wall was not properly funded Chain amp Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime
countries which are doing badly I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level I want safety and security for our people I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund
Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards The Dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for DACA
Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST
Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country Never said take them out Made up by Dems I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians Probably should record future meetings unfortunately no trust
Today it was my great honor to proclaim January  as Martin Luther King Jr Federal Holiday I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of Dr Kings life and legacy
Yesterday was a big day for the stock market Jobs are coming back to America Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing American business is hot again
The Democrats are all talk and no action They are doing nothing to fix DACA Great opportunity missed Too bad
AMERICA FIRST
Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market Chrysler coming back to US Michigan from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED It was headed for disaster
I dont believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA They are all talk and no action This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have Too bad
So much Fake News is being reported They dont even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election
The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un of N Korea Obviously I didnt say that I said Id have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un a big difference Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters
and they knew exactly what I said and meant They just wanted a story FAKE NEWS
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats dont really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military
I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT No more Lotteries AMERICA FIRST
President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy Tax Cut bonuses to more than workers Most explosive Stock Market rally that weve seen in modern times to from Election and grounded in profitability and growth All Trump not 
big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible among many other things President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline Thank you Stuart Varney foxandfriends
Statement by me last night in Florida Honestly I dont think the Democrats want to make a deal They talk about DACA but they dont want to helpWe are ready willing and able to make a deal but they dont want to They dont want security at the border they dont want
to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST amp MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting Deals cant get made when there is no trust Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country
The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now No more dangerous Lottery
Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems Public gets it
 of Trump news coverage was negative and much of it contrivedfoxandfriends
Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled Thank you and it will get even much better FoxNews

The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water
The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous billion dollar trade surplus with the US The billion dollar Wall is peanuts compared to what Mexico makes from the US NAFTA is a bad joke
Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election March Rick is a great guy We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda
We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world If there is no Wall there is no Deal
CHIP should be part of a long term solution not a Day or short term extension

Not looking good for our great Military or Safety amp Security on the very dangerous Southern Border Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy

I have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients amp a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use it
Democrats are not interested in Border Safety amp Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military They are only interested in Obstruction

The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago Rank amp File are great people

Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain sacred cows Other Trump polls are way up also So why does the media refuse to write this Oh well someday
This memo totally vindicates Trump in probe But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead This is an American disgrace
Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages and nobody even talks about them Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion
The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the election and its aftermathThe FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossierthe FBI became
a tool of antiTrump political actors This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the lawThe FBI wasnt straight with Congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators Wall Street Journal
My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work theyve done

Thank you to foxandfriends for exposing the truth Perhaps thats why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition
Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information Must be stopped
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time March th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA Make a deal
Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure
Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law your paychecks are going way UP your taxes are going way DOWN and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS
So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson This is just one of many such preventable tragedies We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST
My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken Colts
Polling shows nearly in Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA fully secures the border ends chain migration amp cancels the visa lottery If Ds oppose this deal they arent serious about DACAthey just want open borders
We need a st century MERITBASED immigration system Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security
Today we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it Watch here

Wow Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch Warner did not want a paper trail on a private meeting in London he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame All tied into Crooked Hillary
Just signed Bill Our Military will now be stronger than ever before We love and need our Military and gave them everything and more First time this has happened in a long time Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS
Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage Must elect more Republicans in Election
Costs on nonmilitary lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the Election and beyond This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now
Jobless claims have dropped to a year low
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods and more would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency Told them to redo and send back in proper form
According to the nytimes a Russian sold phony secrets on Trump to the US Asking price was million brought down to million to be paid over time I hope people are now seeing amp understanding what is going on here It is all now starting to come out DRAIN THE SWAMP
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation Some are true and some are false Some are old and some are new There is no recovery for someone falsely accused life and career are gone Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process
My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the ClintonDNC Dossier it shows that hes been victimized Hes been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of
agencies not just the FBI amp DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I dont believe were accuratehe leaked information corrupt Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on FoxNews
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do The Dems had all three branches of government back in and they decided not to do anything about DACA They only want to use it as a campaign issue Vote Republican
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the WestervillePD
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans
So many positive things going on for the USA and the Fake News Media just doesnt want to go there Same negative stories over and over again No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history MAGA
 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus andor Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut amp Jobs Billand it will only get better We are far ahead of schedule
Rep Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator He is strong amp smart loves Pennsylvania amp loves our Country Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer

Negotiations on DACA have begun Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal Wouldnt it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity March th
As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of AfricanAmericans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all Proclamation 
Today I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore Americas depleted infrastructure 
My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting
So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem Must always report such instances to authorities again and again
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA
In times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need 
The SchumerRoundsCollins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe DHSgov says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in America It creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals doesnt build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa
lottery continues deadly catchandrelease and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement and a vote FOR open borders If Dems are actually serious about DACA they should support the Grassley bill
Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida 
I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth but people whose lives have been totally shattered Am also working with Congress on many fronts
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democratstotally abandoned Republicans are still working hard
Russia started their antiUS campaign in long before I announced that I would run for President The results of the election were not impacted The Trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion
Our entire Nation wone heavy heart continues to pray for the victims amp their families in Parkland FL To teachers law enforcement first responders amp medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger We THANK YOU for your courage 
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida Will never forget them or the evening
Charges Deal Don A Big Win written by Michael Goodwin of the nypost succinctly states that the Russians had no impact on the election results There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign She lost the oldfashioned way by being a terrible candidate Case closed
Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the election
Funny how the Fake News Media doesnt want to say that the Russian group was formed in long before my run for President Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didnt know
The Fake News Media never fails Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman
I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was NOT the main GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads
Just like they dont want to solve the DACA problem why didnt the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House amp Senate during the Obama Administration Because they didnt want to and now they just talk
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter This is not acceptable They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no collusion Get back to the basics and make us all proud
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation
Finally Liddle Adam Schiff the leakin monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the Election He is finally right about something Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing Thank you Adam
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia it never did
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the election But wasnt I a great candidate
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the US then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams They are laughing their asses off in Moscow Get smart America
The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot Big gain over last weeks I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away We need more Republicans

Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey who at one point I knew very well interview a panel of people on Minutes The questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others
Have a great but very reflective Presidents Day
Obama was President up to and beyond the Election So why didnt he do something about Russian meddling
MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to OrrinHatch and has my full support and endorsement
The US economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations amp Taxes have been massively Cut JOBS JOBS JOBS
The Faith of Donald Trump a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb is a very interesting read Enjoy
Thank you to foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more We are now starting to win again
There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig Americas elections theres no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so Id invite Mr Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes
The President Obama quote just before election Thats because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didnt want to rock the boat When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially Also they want to do nothing on DACA Rs want to fix
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House Youve come a long way Matt
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new pushed Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary Your Original was correct Dont let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes amp waste money
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts Total Fake News
A woman I dont know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of Trump Tower years ago Never happened Who would do this in a public space with live security
cameras running Another False Accusation Why doesnt washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me One had her home mortgage paid off Only FoxNews so reporteddoesnt fit the Mainstream Media narrative
Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law This shows smallbusiness owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses
Bad ratings CNN amp MSNBC got scammed when they covered the antiTrump Russia rally walltowall They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise
So true thank you
CNN MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks
Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January th why arent they the subject of the investigation Why didnt Obama do something about the meddling Why arent Dem crimes under investigation Ask Jeff Session
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead There was nobody like him He will be missed by Christians and all religions A very special man
Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January th why arent they the subject of the investigation Why didnt Obama do something about the meddling Why arent Dem crimes under investigation Ask Jeff Sessions
Yesterday it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers the Medal of Valor AmericanHeroes
FLOTUS Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham Our prayers are with his children grandchildren greatgrandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry
I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students teachers and families So much love in the midst of so much pain We must not let them down We must keep our children safeFull Listening Session 
I never said give teachers guns like was stated on Fake News CNN amp NBC What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience only the best of teachers a lot would now be able to
immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this Far more assets at much less cost than guards A gun free school is a magnet for bad people ATTACKS WOULD END
History shows that a school shooting lasts on average minutes It takes police amp first responders approximately to minutes to get to site of crime Highly trained gun adept teacherscoaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive GREAT DETERRENT
If a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school Cowards wont go thereproblem solved Must be offensive defense alone wont work
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health Raise age to and end sale of Bump Stocks Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue I hope
What many people dont understand or dont want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots They love our Country and will do the right thing MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at AM to discuss School Safety Next week it will be with our Nations Governors Its been many years of all talk no action Well get it done

Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania FoxNews This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP

Dems are no longer talking DACA Out of sight out of mind they say DACA beneficiaries should not be happy Nancy Pelosi truly doesnt care about them Republicans stand ready to make a deal
BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING Thank you say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME funny say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump starting to happen

Dem Memo FBI did not disclose who the clients were the Clinton Campaign and the DNC Wow
Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump FoxNews Of course not because there is none and never was This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgraceand Obama did nothing about Russia
Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts FoxNews So what else is new He is a total phony
I will be interviewed by JudgeJeanine on FoxNews at PM Enjoy
Hes got a very good point Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs Clintons criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated I fully agree with the President on that judgenapolitano on marthamaccallum Show
Ive been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year I just dont see the evidencein terms of the collusion its all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have Jonathan Turley on FoxNews
Weve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSIONI have seen nothing the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because hes exercising his power as the President of the US I just dont see it Judge Ken Starr
WITCH HUNT

Why is AG Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse Will take forever has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc Isnt the IG an Obama guy Why not use Justice Department lawyers DISGRACEFUL
Today in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of Gods grace
Starting at a small Bible School in Florida Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival From a large tent in Los Angeles to one hundred thousand people in a single day at Yankee Stadium to more than two million people at Madison Square Garden over sixteen weeks in

Mainstream Media in US is being mocked all over the world Theyve gone CRAZY
The United States has an Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our very stupid trade deals and policies Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years They laugh at what fools our leaders have been No more
If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US They make it impossible for our cars and more to sell there Big trade imbalance
The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People

We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for USA Massive relocation of companies amp jobs Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new amp fair NAFTA agreement is signed Also Canada must
treat our farmers much better Highly restrictive Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the US They have not done what needs to be done Millions of people addicted and dying

According to the Center for Immigration Studies the billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole
Californias sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk Thousands of dangerous amp violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies set free to prey on innocent Americans THIS MUST STOP
If we dont have a wall system were not going to have a country Congress must fund the BORDER WALL amp prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country amp the people of our country We must enforce our laws amp protect our people BuildTheWall

US Consumer Confidence Hits Year High
Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI A great day for Democracy Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI
Happy StPatricksDay
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice amp State DrainTheSwamp
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wifes campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation How many lies How many leaks Comey knew it all and much more
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign WITCH HUNT
Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked have you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous source He said strongly never no He lied as shown clearly on foxandfriends
Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me I dont believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date Same with lying James Comey Can we call them Fake Memos
Why does the Mueller team have hardened Democrats some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans Another Dem recently addeddoes anyone think this is fair And yet there is NO COLLUSION
seanhannity on foxandfriends now Great AM
A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest
The Democrats do not want to help DACA Would be so easy to make a deal
Our Nation was founded by farmers Our independence was won by farmers And our continent was tamed by farmers Our farmers always lead the way we are PROUD of them and we are DELIVERING for them NationalAgricultureDay
AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD Great job by law enforcement and all concerned
Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona I agree with LouDobbs Should have sought review
Special Council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I still am opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because
there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz
Special Council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I am still opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past Obama called him also The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him They are wrong Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing
They can help solve problems with North Korea Syria Ukraine ISIS Iran and even the coming Arms Race Bush tried to get along but didnt have the smarts Obama and Clinton tried but didnt have the energy or chemistry remember RESET PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH
Got Billion to start Wall on Southern Border rest will be forthcoming Most importantly got Billion to rebuild our Military Billion next yearmost ever Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment
Democrats refused to take care of DACA Would have been so easy but they just didnt care I had to fight for Military and start of Wall
Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault He doesnt know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way Dont threaten people Joe
Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillarys large and highly sophisticated staff Well not saying that anymore

DACA was abandoned by the Democrats Very unfair to them Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall
I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats not even mentioned in Bill and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded
News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill PM
Obama Administration legalized bump stocks BAD IDEA As I promised today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns
As a matter of National Security Ive signed the Omnibus Spending Bill I say to Congress I will NEVER sign another bill like this again To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again Im calling on Congress to give me a lineitem veto for all govt spending bills
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday and we grieve the nations loss We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support We are with you EmmanuelMacron

Because of the amp Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military many jobs are created and our Military is again rich Building a great Border Wall with drugs poison and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about National Defense Build WALL through M
Much can be done with the Billion given to building and fixing the border wall It is just a down payment Work will start immediately The rest of the money will come and remember DACA the Democrats abandoned you but we will not
Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia casedont believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on Fame amp fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted Problem is that a new
lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed if for no other reason than they can bill more which is unfair to our great country and I am very happy with my existing team Besides there was NO COLLUSION with Russia except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems
Happy National MedalOfHonorDay to our HEROES We love you

I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election Unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state amp local governments use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy causing tremendous loss to the US and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business
We are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio A tremendous honor to be here today at a stateoftheart training site where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined
JOBS JOBS JOBS Unemployment claims have fallen to a year low Together we are making the economy great again
Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair No more Its time to REBUILD and we will do it with American WORKERS American GRIT and American PRIDE
While we are on the subject it is reported that the US Post Office will lose on average for each package it delivers for Amazon That amounts to Billions of Dollars The Failing NY Times reports that the size of the companys lobbying staff has ballooned and that
does not include the Fake Washington Post which is used as a lobbyist and should so REGISTER If the PO increased its parcel rates Amazons shipping costs would rise by Billion This Post Office scam must stop Amazon must pay real costs and taxes now
Governor Jerry Moonbeam Brown pardoned criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include Kidnapping and Robbery Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize Dealing drugs Is this really what the great people of California want FoxNews

Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal Democrat laws like Catch amp Release Getting more dangerous Caravans coming Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW NO MORE DACA DEAL
Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the US They laugh at our dumb immigration laws They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA NEED WALL
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA They want in on the act
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws
Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People Border Patrol Agents and ICE are GREAT but the weak Dem laws dont allow them to do their job Act now Congress our country is being stolen
DACA is dead because the Democrats didnt care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon No longer works Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTAThey have very strong border laws ours are pathetic With all of the money they make from the US hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws
So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke
Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the countrynot a level playing field
So sad that the Department of Justice and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress An embarrassment to our country
An honor to host the Annual WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake amp Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama Mueller is most conflicted of all except Rosenstein who signed FISA amp Comey letter No Collusion so they go crazy

So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had There wont be anything or anyone even close
Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the Clinton Email probe In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job Slimeball

President Xi of China and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone company ZTE a way to get back into business fast Too many jobs in China lost Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done
China and the United States are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries But be cool it will all work out
Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary Now that will not happen

If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee also Senate Judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers Drain the Swamp
Things are really getting ridiculous The Failing and Crooked but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton nytimes has done a long amp boring story indicating that the Worlds most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia amp me so now they are looking at the rest of the World
At what point does this soon to be Witch Hunt composed of Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for years STOP They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they arent looking at the corruption
in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted Emails got while Secretary of State paid McCabes wife and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M and so much more Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World they should easily be able to take it into the MidTerm Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party Dont worry about Dems FISA Abuse missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier
What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of Democrats FBI They broke into homes amp offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server
and why hasnt the Podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington DC
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia so now theyre looking at the rest of the World Oh great
I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBIDOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration
I ask Senator Chuck Schumer why didnt President Obama amp the Democrats do something about Trade with China including Theft of Intellectual Property etc They did NOTHING With that being said Chuck amp I have long agreed on this issue Fair Trade plus with China will happen
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL FarmAgricultural Products would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years
On China Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time
China must continue to be strong amp tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in I want this to happen and North Korea to be VERY successful but only after signing
John Brennan is panicking He has disgraced himself he has disgraced the Country he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of Americans faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the
top of the FBI Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony Dossierhe knows about the Dossier he denies knowledge of the Dossier he briefs the Gang of on the Hill about the Dossier which
they then used to start an investigation about Trump It is that simple This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle This was a Political hit job this was not an Intelligence Investigation Brennan has disgraced himself hes worried about staying out of Jail Dan Bongino
The Wall Street Journal asks WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA A very good question

Follow the money The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia because there was no Collusion He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win just like they did to Bernie Sanders who got duped
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasnt a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal
foxandfriends New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign Even Clapper worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities
Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State They go after Phony Collusion with Russia a made up Scam and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before What goes around comes around
Its clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign Judge Andrew Napolitano
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history
Everybody is with Tomi Lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman foxandfriends
Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign No James Clapper I am not happy Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot
Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion
Big legislation will be signed by me shortly After many years RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK

Our great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book Liars Leakers and Liberals the Case Against the AntiTrump Conspiracy which is fantastic Go get it
Even if we get Republican votes in the Senate we need Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill amp the Dems are Obstructionists who wont give votes for political reasons amp because they dont care about Crime coming from Border So we need to elect more Rs
Elect more Republicans in November and we will pass the finest fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world Right now we have the dumbest and the worst Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing Remember their motto RESIST Ours is PRODUCE
Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmenwomen in November Dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave

Happy Birthday to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas a friend and great man

AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS
Major Wall Street Journal opinion piece today talking about the Russian Witch Hunt and the disgrace that it is So many people hurt so bad for our country a total sham
Democrats fix the laws Dont RESIST We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama but we need strength and security at the Border Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country Strong Borders No Crime
We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country When somebody comes in we must immediately with no Judges or Court Cases bring them back from where they came Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order Most children come without parents
Our Immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years Immigration must be based on merit we need people who will help to Make America Great Again
The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country remove those Barriers amp Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the USA Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street

Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower Actually far greater than would ever have been believed
The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows badly needs a paint job rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside
I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI although I do not legally have to because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on But you do have to ask why the DOJ amp FBI arent giving over requested documents
Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama Fake News is working overtime
Hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go will always be disfunctional People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the US illegally Children brought back to their country
If this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in its tracks and at very little by comparison cost This is the only real answer and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL
Will be heading to one of my favorite places South Carolina to fight for one of my original fighters Governor Henry McMaster Speaking at PM

Director David Lynch Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents
Why is Senator Mark Warner DVA perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller the leader of the Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt knows Isnt this highly illegal Is it being investigated
The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI amp DOJ should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see We should expose these people for what they are there should be total transparency
Just landed in South Carolina will be at the McMaster rally shortly MAGA
Thank you South Carolina Now lets get out tomorrow and VOTE for HenryMcMaster
Early this year HarleyDavidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand That was long before Tariffs were announced Hence they were just using TariffsTrade War as an excuse Shows how unbalanced amp unfair trade is but we will fix it
We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint They must play fair or they will pay tariffs
When I had HarleyDavidson officials over to the White House I chided them about tariffs in other countries like India being too high Companies are now coming back to America Harley must know that they wont be able to sell back into US without paying a big tax
We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the EU in that they have long taken advantage of the US in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs In the end it will all even out and it wont take very long
It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina Henry is tough on Crime and Borders loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN
A HarleyDavidson should never be built in another countrynever Their employees and customers are already very angry at them If they move watch it will be the beginning of the end they surrendered they quit The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before
The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who together with Nancy Pelosi have established a fine leadership team They should always stay together and lead the Democrats who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime well into the futureand pick Crooked Hillary for Pres
The most profound question of our era Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the US and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy Judge Andrew Napolitano

The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and thats prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country In any event they are coming along very well Most countries agree that they must be changed but nobody ever asked
When we have an infestation of MS GANGS in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out ICE They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country Dems do not appreciate the great job they do Nov
How can the Democrats who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime do well in November The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning and not properly funding our great Law Enforcement

The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country This is not fair nor is it acceptable While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office they must do much more Germany is at the US is at and NATO benefits
Europe far more than it does the US By some accounts the US is paying for of NATO with many countries nowhere close to their commitment On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of Million with the US with big Trade Barriers on US goods NO
I have long heard that the most important decision a US President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice Will be announced tonight at PM
I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed amp even more importantly our handshake We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea China on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese TradeHope Not

Informing the Republican Senators of my nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh SCOTUS
Many countries in NATO which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of which is low but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made Will they reimburse the US
A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans especially Hispanics feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama
The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe US has a Billion trade deficit and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO and nicely pay for it Just doesnt work

ExFBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress Wow but is anybody really surprised Together with her lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER
How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former FBI AgentLover Peter Strzok Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear
Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year at my request but it isnt nearly enough US spends too much Europes borders are BAD Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable
As I head out to a very important NATO meeting I see that FBI LoverAgent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena amp is refusing to show up and testify What can she possibly say about her statements and lies So much corruption on the other side Where is the Attorney General FoxNews
Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia They pay only a fraction of their cost The US pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe and loses Big on Trade
On top of it all Germany just started paying Russia the country they want protection from Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia Not acceptable All NATO Nations must meet their commitment and that must ultimately go to

The stories you heard about the Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administrations Why didnt they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election
Where is the DNC Server and why didnt the FBI take possession of it Deep State
The stories you heard about the Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administration Why didnt they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election
So funny I just checked out Fake News CNN for the first time in a long time they are dying in the ratings to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta actually a nice guy They didnt But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin Fake News
Remember it was Little Jeff Z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said I could not win the election in that there was no way to over amp over again in the Electoral College I got They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage Still hurting
Our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan We commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones
These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years Why didnt Obama do something about it Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win thats why Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration but Fake News doesnt want to report the truth as usual
There hasnt been a missile or rocket fired in months in North Korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages Who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isnt the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts Because it is FAKE NEWS
Heading to Helsinki Finland looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow Unfortunately no matter how well I do at the Summit if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia
over the years I would return to criticism that it wasnt good enough that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems
know how to do is resist and obstruct This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country but at some point it will heal
Congratulations to France who played extraordinary soccer on winning the World Cup Additionally congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament one of the best ever
Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present amp future We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media NATO is now strong amp rich
President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldnt happen was no big deal amp did NOTHING about it When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok
Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of US foolishness and stupidity and now the Rigged Witch Hunt
It was an honor to join you this morning Thank you
Joint Press Conference from Helsinki Finland

A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia but it is good for the world HELSINKI
Will be interviewed on seanhannity tonight at pmE and TuckerCarlson tomorrow night at pmE Enjoy
Thank you RandPaul you really get it The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations whats he supposed think
I had a great meeting with NATO They have paid Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future only because of me NATO was weak but now it is strong again bad for Russia The media only says I was rude to leaders never mentions the money
While I had a great meeting with NATO raising vast amounts of money I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia Sadly it is not being reported that way the Fake News is going Crazy
Thank you RandPaul The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations whats he supposed to think

Prosperity is returning Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern American history Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs
So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match Big results will come
While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with Russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success Many positive things will come out of that meeting
Russia has agreed to help with North Korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along There is no rush the sanctions remain Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process
Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress My endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve Enjoy
A lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming we could have growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again foxandfriends kilmeade
Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia They would rather go to war than see this Its called Trump Derangement Syndrome
 million jobs created since our great Election Victory far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition
Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia The Primary is on Tuesday Brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment I give him my full and total endorsement

Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs Likewise to Pfizer We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs
The Democrats have a death wish in more ways than one they actually want to abolish ICE This should cost them heavily in the Midterms Yesterday the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE
The Fake News Media is going Crazy They make up stories without any backup sources or proof Many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction Problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity But Ill complain anyway
The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia even a confrontation that could lead to war They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that Ill probably have a good relationship with Putin We are doing MUCH better than any other country
Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES Thank you to foxandfriends and FoxNews for actually showing the clips The Fake News wants no part of that narrative Too bad they dont want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set
Really big jobs meeting today at the White House PM

Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES
Will the Dems and Fake News ever learn This is classic
My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri Such a tragedy such a great loss May God be with you all
China the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the US is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge As usual not a level playing field
The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well Tightening now hurts all that we have done The US should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals Debt coming due amp we are raising rates Really
Farmers have been on a downward trend for years The price of soybeans has fallen since years before the Election A big reason is bad terrible Trade Deals with other countries They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers Canada charges on Dairy Farmers will WIN
So important Should have been done years ago
I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy If I was loud amp vicious I would have been criticized for being too tough Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim Hypocrites
The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again cant believe it Isnt it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart The Commissioner must now make a stand First time kneeling out for game Second time kneeling out for seasonno pay
Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyers office early in the morning almost unheard of Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of amp perhaps illegal The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong
The Rigged Witch Hunt headed by the Angry Democrats and now more have been added one who worked directly for Obama WH seems intent on damaging the Republican Partys chances in the November Election This Democrat excuse for losing the Election never ends
No Collusion No Obstruction but that doesnt matter because the Angry Democrats who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing

Congratulations to JudicialWatch and TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of Justice and FBI misled the courts Witch Hunt Rigged a Scam
Looking more amp more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC Ask her how that worked out she did better with Crazy Bernie Republicans must get tough now An illegal Scam
Andrew McCarthy I said this could never happen This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it It is so bad it screams out at you On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt
PeteHegseth on FoxNews Source was the Fake Dossier Yes the Dirty Dossier paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump and looking for information that could discredit Candidate Trump Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign ILLEGAL
I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it So bad for our country
Happy Birthday SenatorDole
So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election Why didnt he do something about it Why didnt he tell our campaign Because it is all a big hoax thats why and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win
To Iranian President Rouhani NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE amp DEATH BE CAUTIOUS
Tom Fitton on foxandfriends at AM NOW Judicial Watch
So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC that was knowingly amp falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt
It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team This is a Clinton Campaign document It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump
and the DOJ FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account Source was the major source Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team Not about Carter Pagewas all about getting Trump
Carter Page wasnt a spy wasnt an agent of the Russians he would have cooperated with the FBI It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump Tom Fitton JudicialWatch A disgrace to America They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now
When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin and all that I gave up remember I gave up NOTHING we merely talked about future benefits for both countries Also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the Corrupt Media
A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in months Likewise no Nuclear Tests Japan is happy all of Asia is happy But the Fake News is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that I am angry because it is not going fast enough Wrong very happy
The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the US Supreme Court two months ago Next up is the US Post Office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their delivery boy for a BIG percentage of their packages
In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for Amazon Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought
Robert will do a great job for our Vets We also recently won Choice
Lou Barletta was one of my first supporters He is tough on Crime and Borders Will be a great Senator from Pennsylvania His opponent is WEAK on Crime ICE and Borders We need Lou

Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate This should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never
Tariffs are the greatest Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with Tariffs Its as simple as that and everybodys talking Remember we are the piggy bank thats being robbed All will be Great

So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldnt approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved much bigger but not Sinclair Disgraceful
The Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton amp Frame Donald Trump is a Hot Seller already Number One More importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett
Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off Lost Billion on Trade last year No weakness
When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity Negotiations are going really well be cool The end result will be worth it
China is targeting our farmers who they know I love amp respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the US They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt We were being nice until now China made Billion on us last year
What kind of a lawyer would tape a client So sad Is this a first never heard of it before Why was the tape so abruptly terminated cut while I was presumably saying positive things I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so Too bad

Great meeting on Trade today with JunckerEU and representatives of the European Union We have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs no barriers and no subsidies Work on documents has already started and the process is moving
along quickly European Union Nations will be open to the United States and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them There was great warmth and feeling in the room a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible
Obviously the European Union as represented by JunckerEU and the United States as represented by yours truly love each other
Thank you Georgia They say that my endorsement last week of Brian Kemp in the Republican Primary for Governor against a very worthy opponent lifted him from points down to a to victory Two very good and talented men in a great race but congratulations to Brian

AlanDersh a brilliant lawyer who although a Liberal Democrat who probably didnt vote for me has discussed the Witch Hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way He has written a new and very important book

America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS and US Steel is back
The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States After so many years this will be a great moment for so many families Thank you to Kim Jong Un
Way to go Jerry This is what the league should do
Arrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major US Steel plant in Granite City Illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion

Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with AG Sulzberger Publisher of the New York Times Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media amp how that Fake News has morphed into phrase Enemy of the People Sad
The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by Billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for African Americans Hispanics Asians and Women
I would be willing to shut down government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall Must get rid of Lottery Catch amp Release etc and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT We need great people coming into our Country
When the media driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome reveals internal deliberations of our government it truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk Very unpatriotic Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news
accurately of media coverage of my Administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving its no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low I will not allow our great country to be sold out by antiTrump haters in the
dying newspaper industry No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people As an example the failing New York Times
and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements and they will never change
There is No Collusion The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt headed now by increased from including an Obama White House lawyer Angry Democrats was started by a fraudulent Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC Therefore the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam

Also why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary others including himself have worked for ObamaAnd why isnt Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity amp real Russian Collusion on the Democrats sidePodesta Dossier

FBI Agent Peter Strzok on the Mueller team should have recused himself on day one He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP He needed an insurance policy Those are illegal improper goals trying to influence the Election He should never ever been allowed to
remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated This is a real issue It wont go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation ALAN DERSHOWITZ
This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further Bob Mueller is totally conflicted and his Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA
Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders He worked for me for a very short time Why didnt government tell me that he was under investigation These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion a Hoax
Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign one of the most successful in history is a TOTAL HOAX The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was along with Comey McCabe Strzok and his lover the lovely Lisa Page used to begin the Witch Hunt Disgraceful

Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated China market has dropped in last months and they are talking to us Our market is stronger than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated America First
Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry Plants are opening all over the US Steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury Other countries use Tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream
Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today Only fools would disagree We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs We win either way
China which is for the first time doing poorly against us is spending a fortune on ads and PR trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on Tariffs because they are really hurting their economy Likewise other countries We are Winning but must be strong

Fake News reporting a complete fabrication that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son Donald had in Trump Tower This was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics and it went nowhere I did not know about it
Why arent Mueller and the Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country Fortunately the facts are all coming out and fast
Too bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS

really bad things Nasty to people amp would constantly miss meetings amp work When Gen Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser amp nothing but problems I told him to try working it out if possible because she only said GREAT things about me until she got fired
While I know its not presidential to take on a lowlife like Omarosa and while I would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible Sorry
The very unpopular Governor of Ohio and failed presidential candidate JohnKasich hurt Troy Baldersons recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate Even Kasichs Lt Governor lost Gov race because of his unpopularity Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN

Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok amp his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI We know this
guy was corrupt and had antiTrump animus Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation Instead Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong He used Strzok he used the Clinton DNC Dossierthe whole thing
should be shut down The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors Thank you Judicial Watch I couldnt have said it better myself
Lou Dobbs This cannot go forwardthis Special Councel with all of his conflicts with his Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia The Dems are the ones who should be investigated Thank you Lou so true

Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia and everybody including the Democrats know it The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary the Democrats and the DNC
Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt why isnt this socalled probe ended immediately Why arent these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary
Lou Dobbs This cannot go forwardthis Special Counsel with all of his conflicts with his Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia The Dems are the ones who should be investigated Thank you Lou so true

Our Country was built on Tariffs and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals as opposed to the horrible and unfair Trade Deals that I inherited as your President Other Countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great USA No longer
Chuck Schumer I agree
John Brennan is a stain on the Country we deserve better than this Former Secret Service Agent and author of new book Spygate the Attempted Sabotage of Donald J Trump Dan Bongino Thank you Dan and good luck with the book

Mark Levin When they had power they didnt stop the Russians the Chinese the North Koreans they funded the Iranians amp are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election amp trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency

Our Economy is doing better than ever Money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before companies earnings are higher than ever inflation is low amp business optimism is higher than it has ever been For the first time in many decades we are protecting our workers
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY It is very bad for our Great CountryBUT WE ARE WINNING
The Boston Globe which was sold to the the Failing New York Times for BILLION DOLLARS plus million dollars in losses amp investment or BILLION DOLLARS was then sold by the Times for DOLLAR Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press PROVE IT
There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people HONESTY WINS

The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr of the Justice Department amp whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok This is too crazy to be believed The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility
While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch Catherine Herridge of FoxNews LouDobbs In other words they were colluding with Russia
Very concerned about Comeys firing afraid they will be exposed said Bruce Ohr DOJs Emails amp Notes show Bruce Ohrs connection to phony amp discredited Trump Dossier A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act Rigged Witch Hunt
TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place Now that is a really good question Then followed by Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero So true a total Fake
How can Senator Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam pass judgement on anyone Loser
An incredibly corrupt FBI amp DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election Brennan has gone off the deep end hes disgraced and discredited himself His conduct has been outrageous Chris Farrell Judicial Watch
Director Brennans recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power If Director Brennans statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA why didnt he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment
released in If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office it constitutes an intelligence breach Richard Burr RNC Senate Intel Cmte Chair LouDobbs
In speaking with some of the worlds top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business jobs even better in the US Stop quarterly reporting amp go to a six month system said one That would allow greater flexibility amp save money I have asked the SEC to study
How does a politician Cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the US survive making the statement WERE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT Which section of the sentence is worse
The local politicians who run Washington DC poorly know a windfall when they see it When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it Never let someone hold you up I will instead
attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date amp go to the Paris parade celebrating the end of the War on November th Maybe we will do something next year in DC when the cost comes WAY DOWN Now we can buy some more jet fighters

Wow Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about Americas lack of greatness I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military setting records and we will do even better Andrew choked badly mistake
When a politician admits that Were not going to make America great again there doesnt seem to be much reason to ever vote for him This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo with many wanting him to resignhe will get higher ratings than his brother Chris
Which is worse Hightax Andrew Cuomos statement WERE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT or Hillary Clintons DEPLORABLES statement
I say Andrews was a bigger and more incompetent blunder He should easily win his race against a Super Liberal Actress but his political career is over
Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the antiTrump Russia probe will be exposed Charles Payne FoxBusiness How much more does Mueller have to see They have blinders on RIGGED
Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy its astonishingthat hes still employed Bruce amp Nelly Ohrs bank account is getting fatter amp fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling He doesnt disclose it under Fed Regs Using your Federal office for personal
Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy its astonishing that hes still employed Bruce amp Nelly Ohrs bank account is getting fatter amp fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling He doesnt disclose it under Fed Regs Using your Federal office for personal
financial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation Bribery Statute Violation Honest Services Violationall Major Crimesbecause the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions Gregg Jarrett So when does Mueller do what must be done Probably never FoxNews
Social Media is totally discriminating against RepublicanConservative voices Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration we wont let that happen They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT while at the same time doing nothing to others
Censorship is a very dangerous thing amp absolutely impossible to police If you are weeding out Fake News there is nothing so Fake as CNN amp MSNBC amp yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or dont watch at all
Too many voices are being destroyed some good amp some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen Who is making the choices because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made Let everybody participate good amp bad and we will all just have to figure it out
All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction China But in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone
Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director He will go down as easily the WORST in history amp since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country
Great Job Rachel CamposDuffy on foxandfriends
The Economy is stronger and better than ever before Importantly there remains tremendous potential it will only get better with time
The United States has ended the ridiculous Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the US I want to develop the US our military and countries that help us
I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Councel In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents Most transparent in history No Collusion No Obstruction Witch Hunt
I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents Most transparent in history No Collusion No Obstruction Witch Hunt
The failing nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel he must be a John Dean type RAT But I allowed him and all others to testify I didnt have to I have nothing to hide
and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close So many lives have been ruined over nothing McCarthyism at its WORST Yet Mueller amp his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side Media is even worse
No Collusion and No Obstruction except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats All of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction What about the Brennan Comey McCabe Strzok lies to Congress or Crookeds Emails
The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President when in fact it is just the opposite amp the two Fake reporters knew this This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People So bad for America
Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times They actually called to complain and apologize a big step forward From the day I announced the Times has been Fake News and with their disgusting new Board Member it will only get worse
Study the late Joseph McCarthy because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby Rigged Witch Hunt
Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over hours with the White House Councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone
looking for trouble They are enjoying ruining peoples lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side the lies the firings the deleted Emails and soooo much more Muellers Angry Dems are looking to impact the election They are a National Disgrace
Wheres the Collusion They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction of a phony crime that never existed If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction
I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our countrys history brings a lawsuit It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt He wont sue
Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance its worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan It certainly isnt because of the good job he did He is a political hack
Will Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions Justice Department A total joke
Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multimillion dollar investigation into what apparently didnt happen Darrell Issa House Oversight We can take out the word apparently FoxNews
It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the US Postal System from China We can and must END THIS NOW The Senate should pass the STOP ACT and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country No more delay

A large number of counts ten could not even be decided in the Paul Manafort case Witch Hunt
Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled

I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea at this time because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
Additionally because of our much tougher Trading stance with China I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were despite the UN Sanctions which are in place
Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim I look forward to seeing him soon
Thank you I love you Ohio

StopTheBias
STATEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSEPresident Donald J Trump feels strongly that North Korea is under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese Government At the same time we also know that China is providing North Korea with
considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and various other commodities This is not helpful Nonetheless the President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong Un is a very good and warm one and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts
of money on joint USSouth Korea war games Besides the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea and Japan if he so chooses If he does they will be far bigger than ever before As for the trade disputes and other
differences they will be resolved in time by President Trump and Chinas great President Xi Jinping Their relationship and bond remain very strong

No information was ever given by the Trump Team to Russia yet the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for information from Kremlin sources and just washed it through an intermediary Christopher Steele Jesse Waters
There is no possible way the Trump Tower meeting between Don Trump jr and a couple of Russians who have very deep connections to both the Clintons amp Fusion GPS amp where no information on the Clintons was exchanged is a crime Dems are blinded by their hatred of Trump Bongino
