      "the quarrel between agamemnon and achilles--achilles withdraws  from the war, and sends his mother thetis to ask jove to help  the trojans--scene between jove and juno on olympus.sing, o goddess, the anger of achilles son of peleus, that broughtcountless ills upon the achaeans. many a brave soul did it sendhurrying down to hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs andvultures, for so were the counsels of jove fulfilled from the day onwhich the son of atreus, king of men, and great achilles, first fellout with one another.and which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? it was theson of jove and leto; for he was angry with the king and sent apestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son ofatreus had dishonoured chryses his priest. now chryses had come to theships of the achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him agreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of apollowreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and he besought the achaeans, butmost of all the two sons of atreus, who were their chiefs.\"sons of atreus,\" he cried, \"and all other achaeans, may the gods whodwell in olympus grant you to sack the city of priam, and to reach yourhomes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, inreverence to apollo, son of jove.\"on this the rest of the achaeans with one voice were for respecting thepriest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so agamemnon, whospoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. \"old man,\" said he,\"let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet cominghereafter. your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit younothing. i will not free her. she shall grow old in my house at argosfar from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting mycouch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.\"the old man feared him and obeyed. not a word he spoke, but went by theshore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to king apollo whom lovelyleto had borne. \"hear me,\" he cried, \"o god of the silver bow, thatprotectest chryse and holy cilla and rulest tenedos with thy might,hear me oh thou of sminthe. if i have ever decked your temple withgarlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant myprayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the danaans.\"thus did he pray, and apollo heard his prayer. he came down furiousfrom the summits of olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon hisshoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage thattrembled within him. he sat himself down away from the ships with aface as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot hisarrow in the midst of them. first he smote their mules and theirhounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, andall day long the pyres of the dead were burning.for nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon thetenth day achilles called them in assembly--moved thereto by juno, whosaw the achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them.then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.\"son of atreus,\" said he, \"i deem that we should now turn roving homeif we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war andpestilence at once. let us ask some priest or prophet, or some readerof dreams (for dreams, too, are of jove) who can tell us why phoebusapollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we havebroken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he willaccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to takeaway the plague from us.\"with these words he sat down, and calchas son of thestor, wisest ofaugurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. he itwas who had guided the achaeans with their fleet to ilius, through theprophesyings with which phoebus apollo had inspired him. with allsincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:--\"achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of kingapollo, i will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that youwill stand by me heartily in word and deed, for i know that i shalloffend one who rules the argives with might, to whom all the achaeansare in subjection. a plain man cannot stand against the anger of aking, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revengetill he has wreaked it. consider, therefore, whether or no you willprotect me.\"and achilles answered, \"fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon youfrom heaven, for by apollo, calchas, to whom you pray, and whoseoracles you reveal to us, not a danaan at our ships shall lay his handupon you, while i yet live to look upon the face of the earth--no, notthough you name agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of theachaeans.\"thereon the seer spoke boldly. \"the god,\" he said, \"is angry neitherabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom agamemnon hasdishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a ransomfor her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will yet sendothers. he will not deliver the danaans from this pestilence tillagamemnon has restored the girl without fee or ransom to her father,and has sent a holy hecatomb to chryse. thus we may perhaps appeasehim.\"with these words he sat down, and agamemnon rose in anger. his heartwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on calchasand said, \"seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth thingsconcerning me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. youhave brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you comeseeing among danaans, and saying that apollo has plagued us because iwould not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of chryses. i haveset my heart on keeping her in my own house, for i love her better eventhan my own wife clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form andfeature, in understanding and accomplishments. still i will give her upif i must, for i would have the people live, not die; but you must findme a prize instead, or i alone among the argives shall be without one.this is not well; for you behold, all of you, that my prize is to goelsewhither.\"and achilles answered, \"most noble son of atreus, covetous beyond allmankind, how shall the achaeans find you another prize? we have nocommon store from which to take one. those we took from the cities havebeen awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been madealready. give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever jove grantsus to sack the city of troy we will requite you three and fourfold.\"then agamemnon said, \"achilles, valiant though you be, you shall notthus outwit me. you shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me.are you to keep your own prize, while i sit tamely under my loss andgive up the girl at your bidding? let the achaeans find me a prize infair exchange to my liking, or i will come and take your own, or thatof ajax or of ulysses; and he to whomsoever i may come shall rue mycoming. but of this we will take thought hereafter; for the present,let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; letus put a hecatomb on board, and let us send chryseis also; further, letsome chief man among us be in command, either ajax, or idomeneus, oryourself, son of peleus, mighty warrior that you are, that we may offersacrifice and appease the anger of the god.\"achilles scowled at him and answered, \"you are steeped in insolence andlust of gain. with what heart can any of the achaeans do your bidding,either on foray or in open fighting? i came not warring here for anyill the trojans had done me. i have no quarrel with them. they have notraided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests on the richplains of phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, bothmountain and sounding sea. we have followed you, sir insolence! foryour pleasure, not ours--to gain satisfaction from the trojans for yourshameless self and for menelaus. you forget this, and threaten to robme of the prize for which i have toiled, and which the sons of theachaeans have given me. never when the achaeans sack any rich city ofthe trojans do i receive so good a prize as you do, though it is myhands that do the better part of the fighting. when the sharing comes,your share is far the largest, and i, forsooth, must go back to myships, take what i can get and be thankful, when my labour of fightingis done. now, therefore, i shall go back to phthia; it will be muchbetter for me to return home with my ships, for i will not stay heredishonoured to gather gold and substance for you.\"and agamemnon answered, \"fly if you will, i shall make you no prayersto stay you. i have others here who will do me honour, and above alljove, the lord of counsel. there is no king here so hateful to me asyou are, for you are ever quarrelsome and ill-affected. what though yoube brave? was it not heaven that made you so? go home, then, with yourships and comrades to lord it over the myrmidons. i care neither foryou nor for your anger; and thus will i do: since phoebus apollo istaking chryseis from me, i shall send her with my ship and myfollowers, but i shall come to your tent and take your own prizebriseis, that you may learn how much stronger i am than you are, andthat another may fear to set himself up as equal or comparable with me.\"the son of peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy breastwas divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and killthe son of atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger. while hewas thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from itsscabbard, minerva came down from heaven (for juno had sent her in thelove she bore to them both), and seized the son of peleus by his yellowhair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could see her.achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes atonce knew that she was minerva. \"why are you here,\" said he, \"daughterof aegis-bearing jove? to see the pride of agamemnon, son of atreus?let me tell you--and it shall surely be--he shall pay for thisinsolence with his life.\"and minerva said, \"i come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid youstay your anger. juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike.cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him ifyou will, and your railing will not be vain, for i tell you--and itshall surely be--that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times assplendid by reason of this present insult. hold, therefore, and obey.\"\"goddess,\" answered achilles, \"however angry a man may be, he must doas you two command him. this will be best, for the gods ever hear theprayers of him who has obeyed them.\"he stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it backinto the scabbard as minerva bade him. then she went back to olympusamong the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing jove.but the son of peleus again began railing at the son of atreus, for hewas still in a rage. \"wine-bibber,\" he cried, \"with the face of a dogand the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host infight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. you shun this as youdo death itself. you had rather go round and rob his prizes from anyman who contradicts you. you devour your people, for you are king overa feeble folk; otherwise, son of atreus, henceforward you would insultno man. therefore i say, and swear it with a great oath--nay, by thismy sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew fromthe day on which it left its parent stem upon the mountains--for theaxe stripped it of leaf and bark, and now the sons of the achaeans bearit as judges and guardians of the decrees of heaven--so surely andsolemnly do i swear that hereafter they shall look fondly for achillesand shall not find him. in the day of your distress, when your men falldying by the murderous hand of hector, you shall not know how to helpthem, and shall rend your heart with rage for the hour when you offeredinsult to the bravest of the achaeans.\"with this the son of peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on theground and took his seat, while the son of atreus was beginningfiercely from his place upon the other side. then uprose smooth-tonguednestor, the facile speaker of the pylians, and the words fell from hislips sweeter than honey. two generations of men born and bred in pyloshad passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third.with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:--\"of a truth,\" he said, \"a great sorrow has befallen the achaean land.surely priam with his sons would rejoice, and the trojans be glad atheart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are soexcellent in fight and counsel. i am older than either of you;therefore be guided by me. moreover i have been the familiar friend ofmen even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.never again can i behold such men as pirithous and dryas shepherd ofhis people, or as caeneus, exadius, godlike polyphemus, and theseus sonof aegeus, peer of the immortals. these were the mightiest men everborn upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought thefiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. i camefrom distant pylos, and went about among them, for they would have mecome, and i fought as it was in me to do. not a man now living couldwithstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded by them. sobe it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent way.therefore, agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl away,for the sons of the achaeans have already given her to achilles; andyou, achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who by thegrace of jove wields a sceptre has like honour with agamemnon. you arestrong, and have a goddess for your mother; but agamemnon is strongerthan you, for he has more people under him. son of atreus, check youranger, i implore you; end this quarrel with achilles, who in the day ofbattle is a tower of strength to the achaeans.\"and agamemnon answered, \"sir, all that you have said is true, but thisfellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord of all,king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be. granted thatthe gods have made him a great warrior, have they also given him theright to speak with railing?\"achilles interrupted him. \"i should be a mean coward,\" he cried, \"werei to give in to you in all things. order other people about, not me,for i shall obey no longer. furthermore i say--and lay my saying toyour heart--i shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl, forthose that take were those also that gave. but of all else that is atmy ship you shall carry away nothing by force. try, that others maysee; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood.\"when they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up theassembly at the ships of the achaeans. the son of peleus went back tohis tents and ships with the son of menoetius and his company, whileagamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twentyoarsmen. he escorted chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb forthe god. and ulysses went as captain.these, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. but theson of atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purifiedthemselves and cast their filth into the sea. then they offeredhecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and thesmoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards heaven.thus did they busy themselves throughout the host. but agamemnon didnot forget the threat that he had made achilles, and called his trustymessengers and squires talthybius and eurybates. \"go,\" said he, \"to thetent of achilles, son of peleus; take briseis by the hand and bring herhither; if he will not give her i shall come with others and takeher--which will press him harder.\"he charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon theywent their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tentsand ships of the myrmidons. they found achilles sitting by his tent andhis ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. they stoodfearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak,but he knew them and said, \"welcome, heralds, messengers of gods andmen; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with agamemnon who hassent you for the girl briseis. therefore, patroclus, bring her and giveher to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortalmen, and by the fierceness of agamemnon's anger, that if ever againthere be need of me to save the people from ruin, they shall seek andthey shall not find. agamemnon is mad with rage and knows not how tolook before and after that the achaeans may fight by their ships insafety.\"patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. he brought briseisfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with themto the ships of the achaeans--and the woman was loth to go. thenachilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping andlooking out upon the boundless waste of waters. he raised his hands inprayer to his immortal mother, \"mother,\" he cried, \"you bore me doomedto live but for a little season; surely jove, who thunders fromolympus, might have made that little glorious. it is not so. agamemnon,son of atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize byforce.\"as he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she wassitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.forthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat downbefore him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said,\"my son, why are you weeping? what is it that grieves you? keep it notfrom me, but tell me, that we may know it together.\"achilles drew a deep sigh and said, \"you know it; why tell you what youknow well already? we went to thebe the strong city of eetion, sackedit, and brought hither the spoil. the sons of the achaeans shared itduly among themselves, and chose lovely chryseis as the meed ofagamemnon; but chryses, priest of apollo, came to the ships of theachaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great ransom:moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of apollo, wreathed with asuppliant's wreath, and he besought the achaeans, but most of all thetwo sons of atreus who were their chiefs.\"on this the rest of the achaeans with one voice were for respectingthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so agamemnon,who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. so he went back inanger, and apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. then the godsent a deadly dart upon the argives, and the people died thick on oneanother, for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host of theachaeans. at last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared to usthe oracles of apollo, and i was myself first to say that we shouldappease him. whereon the son of atreus rose in anger, and threatenedthat which he has since done. the achaeans are now taking the girl in aship to chryse, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but theheralds have just taken from my tent the daughter of briseus, whom theachaeans had awarded to myself.\"help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. go to olympus, and ifyou have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid ofjove. ofttimes in my father's house have i heard you glory in that youalone of the immortals saved the son of saturn from ruin, when theothers, with juno, neptune, and pallas minerva would have put him inbonds. it was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to olympus thehundred-handed monster whom gods call briareus, but men aegaeon, for heis stronger even than his father; when therefore he took his seatall-glorious beside the son of saturn, the other gods were afraid, anddid not bind him. go, then, to him, remind him of all this, clasp hisknees, and bid him give succour to the trojans. let the achaeans behemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish on the sea-shore,that they may reap what joy they may of their king, and that agamemnonmay rue his blindness in offering insult to the foremost of theachaeans.\"thetis wept and answered, \"my son, woe is me that i should have borneor suckled you. would indeed that you had lived your span free from allsorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you should beat once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers: woe,therefore, was the hour in which i bore you; nevertheless i will go tothe snowy heights of olympus, and tell this tale to jove, if he willhear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your ships, nurseyour anger against the achaeans, and hold aloof from fight. for jovewent yesterday to oceanus, to a feast among the ethiopians, and theother gods went with him. he will return to olympus twelve days hence;i will then go to his mansion paved with bronze and will beseech him;nor do i doubt that i shall be able to persuade him.\"on this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had beentaken from him. meanwhile ulysses reached chryse with the hecatomb.when they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laidthem in the ship's hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the mastinto its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would haveher lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast thehawsers. they then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatombfor apollo; chryseis also left the ship, and ulysses led her to thealtar to deliver her into the hands of her father. \"chryses,\" said he,\"king agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and to offersacrifice to apollo on behalf of the danaans, that we may propitiatethe god, who has now brought sorrow upon the argives.\"so saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly,and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of thegod. they washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkleover the victims, while chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud ontheir behalf. \"hear me,\" he cried, \"o god of the silver bow, thatprotectest chryse and holy cilla, and rulest tenedos with thy might.even as thou didst hear me aforetime when i prayed, and didst presshardly upon the achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearfulpestilence from the danaans.\"thus did he pray, and apollo heard his prayer. when they had donepraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of thevictims and killed and flayed them. they cut out the thigh-bones,wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat onthe top of them, and then chryses laid them on the wood fire and pouredwine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-prongedspits in their hands. when the thigh-bones were burned and they hadtasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the piecesupon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off:then, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, theyate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled themixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving everyman his drink-offering.thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymninghim and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in theirvoices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laidthemselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when thechild of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared they again set sail forthe host of the achaeans. apollo sent them a fair wind, so they raisedtheir mast and hoisted their white sails aloft. as the sail belliedwith the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foamhissed against her bows as she sped onward. when they reached thewide-stretching host of the achaeans, they drew the vessel ashore, highand dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath her, and wenttheir ways to their own tents and ships.but achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. he went not tothe honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed athis own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.now after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to olympus,and jove led the way. thetis was not unmindful of the charge her sonhad laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went throughgreat heaven with early morning to olympus, where she found the mightyson of saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. she satherself down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, whilewith her right she caught him under the chin, and besought him,saying:--\"father jove, if i ever did you service in word or deed among theimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is to becut short so early. king agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking hisprize and keeping her. honour him then yourself, olympian lord ofcounsel, and grant victory to the trojans, till the achaeans give myson his due and load him with riches in requital.\"jove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but thetis still keptfirm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. \"incline yourhead,\" said she, \"and promise me surely, or else deny me--for you havenothing to fear--that i may learn how greatly you disdain me.\"at this jove was much troubled and answered, \"i shall have trouble ifyou set me quarrelling with juno, for she will provoke me with hertaunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before theother gods and accusing me of giving aid to the trojans. go back now,lest she should find out. i will consider the matter, and will bring itabout as you wish. see, i incline my head that you may believe me. thisis the most solemn promise that i can give to any god. i never recallmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what i say, when i have nodded myhead.\"as he spoke the son of saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosiallocks swayed on his immortal head, till vast olympus reeled.when the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted--jove to hishouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of olympus, and plungedinto the depths of the sea. the gods rose from their seats, before thecoming of their sire. not one of them dared to remain sitting, but allstood up as he came among them. there, then, he took his seat. butjuno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman's daughter,silver-footed thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once beganto upbraid him. \"trickster,\" she cried, \"which of the gods have youbeen taking into your counsels now? you are always settling matters insecret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could helpit, one word of your intentions.\"\"juno,\" replied the sire of gods and men, \"you must not expect to beinformed of all my counsels. you are my wife, but you would find ithard to understand them. when it is proper for you to hear, there is noone, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when i mean to keep amatter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions.\"\"dread son of saturn,\" answered juno, \"what are you talking about? i?pry and ask questions? never. i let you have your own way ineverything. still, i have a strong misgiving that the old merman'sdaughter thetis has been talking you over, for she was with you and hadhold of your knees this self-same morning. i believe, therefore, thatyou have been promising her to give glory to achilles, and to kill muchpeople at the ships of the achaeans.\"\"wife,\" said jove, \"i can do nothing but you suspect me and find itout. you will take nothing by it, for i shall only dislike you themore, and it will go harder with you. granted that it is as you say; imean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as i bid you for if ionce begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were on yourside it would profit you nothing.\"on this juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and satdown in silence. but the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout thehouse of jove, till the cunning workman vulcan began to try and pacifyhis mother juno. \"it will be intolerable,\" said he, \"if you two fall towrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of mortals. ifsuch ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at ourbanquet. let me then advise my mother--and she must herself know thatit will be better--to make friends with my dear father jove, lest heagain scold her and disturb our feast. if the olympian thunderer wantsto hurl us all from our seats, he can do so, for he is far thestrongest, so give him fair words, and he will then soon be in a goodhumour with us.\"as he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in hismother's hand. \"cheer up, my dear mother,\" said he, \"and make the bestof it. i love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get athrashing; however grieved i might be, i could not help, for there isno standing against jove. once before when i was trying to help you, hecaught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold. all daylong from morn till eve, was i falling, till at sunset i came to groundin the island of lemnos, and there i lay, with very little life left inme, till the sintians came and tended me.\"juno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her son'shands. then vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and servedit round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed godslaughed out a loud applause as they saw him bustling about the heavenlymansion.thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun theyfeasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.apollo struck his lyre, and the muses lifted up their sweet voices,calling and answering one another. but when the sun's glorious lighthad faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lamevulcan with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. so jove, theolympian lord of thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept;and when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with juno of the goldenthrone by his side.book ii  jove sends a lying dream to agamemnon, who thereon calls the  chiefs in assembly, and proposes to sound the mind of his  army--in the end they march to fight--catalogue of the  achaean and trojan forces.now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly,but jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to achilles,and destroyed much people at the ships of the achaeans. in the end hedeemed it would be best to send a lying dream to king agamemnon; so hecalled one to him and said to it, \"lying dream, go to the ships of theachaeans, into the tent of agamemnon, and say to him word for word as inow bid you. tell him to get the achaeans instantly under arms, for heshall take troy. there are no longer divided counsels among the gods;juno has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the trojans.\"the dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached theships of the achaeans. it sought agamemnon son of atreus and found himin his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. it hovered over his head inthe likeness of nestor, son of neleus, whom agamemnon honoured aboveall his councillors, and said:--\"you are sleeping, son of atreus; one who has the welfare of his hostand so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. hearme at once, for i come as a messenger from jove, who, though he be notnear, yet takes thought for you and pities you. he bids you get theachaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take troy. there are nolonger divided counsels among the gods; juno has brought them over toher own mind, and woe betides the trojans at the hands of jove.remember this, and when you wake see that it does not escape you.\"the dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely notto be accomplished. he thought that on that same day he was to take thecity of priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of jove, who hadmany another hard-fought fight in store alike for danaans and trojans.then presently he woke, with the divine message still ringing in hisears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt so fair and new, andover this his heavy cloak. he bound his sandals on to his comely feet,and slung his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he tookthe imperishable staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships ofthe achaeans.the goddess dawn now wended her way to vast olympus that she mightherald day to jove and to the other immortals, and agamemnon sent thecriers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them andthe people gathered thereon. but first he summoned a meeting of theelders at the ship of nestor king of pylos, and when they wereassembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.\"my friends,\" said he, \"i have had a dream from heaven in the dead ofnight, and its face and figure resembled none but nestor's. it hoveredover my head and said, 'you are sleeping, son of atreus; one who hasthe welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shouldersshould dock his sleep. hear me at once, for i am a messenger from jove,who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you.he bids you get the achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall taketroy. there are no longer divided counsels among the gods; juno hasbrought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the trojans at thehands of jove. remember this.' the dream then vanished and i awoke. letus now, therefore, arm the sons of the achaeans. but it will be wellthat i should first sound them, and to this end i will tell them to flywith their ships; but do you others go about among the host and preventtheir doing so.\"he then sat down, and nestor the prince of pylos with all sincerity andgoodwill addressed them thus: \"my friends,\" said he, \"princes andcouncillors of the argives, if any other man of the achaeans had toldus of this dream we should have declared it false, and would have hadnothing to do with it. but he who has seen it is the foremost man amongus; we must therefore set about getting the people under arms.\"with this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptredkings rose with him in obedience to the word of agamemnon; but thepeople pressed forward to hear. they swarmed like bees that sally fromsome hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring flowers,bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude pourfrom ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon thewide-watered shore, while among them ran wildfire rumour, messenger ofjove, urging them ever to the fore. thus they gathered in a pell-mellof mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as thepeople sought their places. nine heralds went crying about among themto stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at lastthey were got into their several places and ceased their clamour. thenking agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. this was the work of vulcan,who gave it to jove the son of saturn. jove gave it to mercury, slayerof argus, guide and guardian. king mercury gave it to pelops, themighty charioteer, and pelops to atreus, shepherd of his people.atreus, when he died, left it to thyestes, rich in flocks, and thyestesin his turn left it to be borne by agamemnon, that he might be lord ofall argos and of the isles. leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressedthe argives.\"my friends,\" he said, \"heroes, servants of mars, the hand of heavenhas been laid heavily upon me. cruel jove gave me his solemn promisethat i should sack the city of priam before returning, but he hasplayed me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to argoswith the loss of much people. such is the will of jove, who has laidmany a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his poweris above all. it will be a sorry tale hereafter that an achaean host,at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer innumber than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. think thatthe achaeans and trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that theyhave each been numbered--the trojans by the roll of their householders,and we by companies of ten; think further that each of our companiesdesired to have a trojan householder to pour out their wine; we are sogreatly more in number that full many a company would have to gowithout its cup-bearer. but they have in the town allies from otherplaces, and it is these that hinder me from being able to sack the richcity of ilius. nine of jove's years are gone; the timbers of our shipshave rotted; their tackling is sound no longer. our wives and littleones at home look anxiously for our coming, but the work that we camehither to do has not been done. now, therefore, let us all do as i say:let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take troy.\"with these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of themas knew not the cunning counsel of agamemnon. they surged to and frolike the waves of the icarian sea, when the east and south winds breakfrom heaven's clouds to lash them; or as when the west wind sweeps overa field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast, even so were theyswayed as they flew with loud cries towards the ships, and the dustfrom under their feet rose heavenward. they cheered each other on todraw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels in front ofthem; they began taking away the stays from underneath them, and thewelkin rang with their glad cries, so eager were they to return.then surely the argives would have returned after a fashion that wasnot fated. but juno said to minerva, \"alas, daughter of aegis-bearingjove, unweariable, shall the argives fly home to their own land overthe broad sea, and leave priam and the trojans the glory of stillkeeping helen, for whose sake so many of the achaeans have died attroy, far from their homes? go about at once among the host, and speakfairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into thesea.\"minerva was not slack to do her bidding. down she darted from thetopmost summits of olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of theachaeans. there she found ulysses, peer of jove in counsel, standingalone. he had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grievedand sorry; so she went close up to him and said, \"ulysses, noble son oflaertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be offhome to your own land in this way? will you leave priam and the trojansthe glory of still keeping helen, for whose sake so many of theachaeans have died at troy, far from their homes? go about at onceamong the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they drawnot their ships into the sea.\"ulysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak fromhim and set off to run. his servant eurybates, a man of ithaca, whowaited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon ulysses went straightup to agamemnon and received from him his ancestral, imperishablestaff. with this he went about among the ships of the achaeans.whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke himfairly. \"sir,\" said he, \"this flight is cowardly and unworthy. stand toyour post, and bid your people also keep their places. you do not yetknow the full mind of agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long willvisit the achaeans with his displeasure. we were not all of us at thecouncil to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry and do usa mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the hand of jove iswith them.\"but when he came across any common man who was making a noise, hestruck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, \"sirrah, hold yourpeace, and listen to better men than yourself. you are a coward and nosoldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all bekings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one man mustbe supreme--one king to whom the son of scheming saturn has given thesceptre of sovereignty over you all.\"thus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people hurriedback to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as thethunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all thesea is in an uproar.the rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places, butthersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue--a man of manywords, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against allwho were in authority, who cared not what he said, so that he might setthe achaeans in a laugh. he was the ugliest man of all those that camebefore troy--bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shouldersrounded and hunched over his chest. his head ran up to a point, butthere was little hair on the top of it. achilles and ulysses hated himworst of all, for it was with them that he was most wont to wrangle;now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began heaping his abuse onagamemnon. the achaeans were angry and disgusted, yet none the less hekept on brawling and bawling at the son of atreus.\"agamemnon,\" he cried, \"what ails you now, and what more do you want?your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever wetake a town we give you the pick of them. would you have yet more gold,which some trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when i oranother achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl tohide and lie with? it is not well that you, the ruler of the achaeans,should bring them into such misery. weakling cowards, women rather thanmen, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at troy to stew inhis own meeds of honour, and discover whether we were of any service tohim or no. achilles is a much better man than he is, and see how he hastreated him--robbing him of his prize and keeping it himself. achillestakes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son of atreus, you wouldnever again insult him.\"thus railed thersites, but ulysses at once went up to him and rebukedhim sternly. \"check your glib tongue, thersites,\" said be, \"and babblenot a word further. chide not with princes when you have none to backyou. there is no viler creature come before troy with the sons ofatreus. drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor keepharping about going home. we do not yet know how things are going tobe, nor whether the achaeans are to return with good success or evil.how dare you gibe at agamemnon because the danaans have awarded him somany prizes? i tell you, therefore--and it shall surely be--that if iagain catch you talking such nonsense, i will either forfeit my ownhead and be no more called father of telemachus, or i will take you,strip you stark naked, and whip you out of the assembly till you goblubbering back to the ships.\"on this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till hedropped and fell a-weeping. the golden sceptre raised a bloody weal onhis back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish as hewiped the tears from his eyes. the people were sorry for him, yet theylaughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying, \"ulysseshas done many a good thing ere now in fight and council, but he neverdid the argives a better turn than when he stopped this fellow's mouthfrom prating further. he will give the kings no more of his insolence.\"thus said the people. then ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and minervain the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those whowere far off might hear him and consider his council. he therefore withall sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:--\"king agamemnon, the achaeans are for making you a by-word among allmankind. they forget the promise they made you when they set out fromargos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of troy,and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set offhomeward. true it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened.a man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a singlemonth, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it isnow nine long years that we have been kept here; i cannot, therefore,blame the achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if wego home empty after so long a stay--therefore, my friends, be patientyet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings ofcalchas were false or true.\"all who have not since perished must remember as though it wereyesterday or the day before, how the ships of the achaeans weredetained in aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on priamand the trojans. we were ranged round about a fountain offeringhecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a fineplane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of pure water. thenwe saw a prodigy; for jove sent a fearful serpent out of the ground,with blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from under the altaron to the plane-tree. now there was a brood of young sparrows, quitesmall, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves, eightin all, and their mother that hatched them made nine. the serpent atethe poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting herlittle ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught herby the wing as she was screaming. then, when he had eaten both thesparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him become a sign;for the son of scheming saturn turned him into stone, and we stoodthere wondering at that which had come to pass. seeing, then, that sucha fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, calchas forthwithdeclared to us the oracles of heaven. 'why, achaeans,' said he, 'areyou thus speechless? jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, andlong ere it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. as theserpent ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them,which makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at troy, but in thetenth shall take the town.' this was what he said, and now it is allcoming true. stay here, therefore, all of you, till we take the city ofpriam.\"on this the argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with theuproar. nestor, knight of gerene, then addressed them. \"shame on you,\"he cried, \"to stay talking here like children, when you should fightlike men. where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we havetaken? shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with ourdrink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have putour trust? we waste our time in words, and for all our talking hereshall be no further forward. stand, therefore, son of atreus, by yourown steadfast purpose; lead the argives on to battle, and leave thishandful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back toargos ere they have learned whether jove be true or a liar. for themighty son of saturn surely promised that we should succeed, when weargives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the trojans. heshowed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning on our righthands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has first lain withthe wife of some trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that he hassuffered for the sake of helen. nevertheless, if any man is in suchhaste to be at home again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he maymeet his doom in the sight of all. but, o king, consider and give earto my counsel, for the word that i say may not be neglected lightly.divide your men, agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, thatclans and tribes may stand by and help one another. if you do this, andif the achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs andpeoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against theother. thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel ofheaven or the cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town.\"and agamemnon answered, \"nestor, you have again outdone the sons of theachaeans in counsel. would, by father jove, minerva, and apollo, that ihad among them ten more such councillors, for the city of king priamwould then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it. but theson of saturn afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife. achillesand i are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter i was the firstto offend; if we can be of one mind again, the trojans will not staveoff destruction for a day. now, therefore, get your morning meal, thatour hosts join in fight. whet well your spears; see well to theordering of your shields; give good feeds to your horses, and look yourchariots carefully over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for weshall have no rest, not for a moment, till night falls to part us. thebands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat upon yourshoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears, your horses shallsteam in front of your chariots, and if i see any man shirking thefight, or trying to keep out of it at the ships, there shall be no helpfor him, but he shall be a prey to dogs and vultures.\"thus he spoke, and the achaeans roared applause. as when the waves runhigh before the blast of the south wind and break on some loftyheadland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as thestorms from every quarter drive them, even so did the achaeans rise andhurry in all directions to their ships. there they lighted their firesat their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every man to one orother of the gods, and praying each one of them that he might live tocome out of the fight. agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fatfive-year-old bull to the mighty son of saturn, and invited the princesand elders of his host. first he asked nestor and king idomeneus, thenthe two ajaxes and the son of tydeus, and sixthly ulysses, peer of godsin counsel; but menelaus came of his own accord, for he knew how busyhis brother then was. they stood round the bull with the barley-meal intheir hands, and agamemnon prayed, saying, \"jove, most glorious,supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest upon the storm-cloud,grant that the sun may not go down, nor the night fall, till the palaceof priam is laid low, and its gates are consumed with fire. grant thatmy sword may pierce the shirt of hector about his heart, and that fullmany of his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him.\"thus he prayed, but the son of saturn would not fulfil his prayer. heaccepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toilcontinually. when they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-mealupon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayedit. they cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers offat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. these they burnedupon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inward meats, andheld them in the flames to cook. when the thigh-bones were burned, andthey had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put thepieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off;then, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, theyate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, nestor, knight ofgerene, began to speak. \"king agamemnon,\" said he, \"let us not staytalking here, nor be slack in the work that heaven has put into ourhands. let the heralds summon the people to gather at their severalships; we will then go about among the host, that we may begin fightingat once.\"thus did he speak, and agamemnon heeded his words. he at once sent thecriers round to call the people in assembly. so they called them, andthe people gathered thereon. the chiefs about the son of atreus chosetheir men and marshalled them, while minerva went among them holdingher priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death. from it therewaved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one ofthem worth a hundred oxen. with this she darted furiously everywhereamong the hosts of the achaeans, urging them forward, and puttingcourage into the heart of each, so that he might fight and do battlewithout ceasing. thus war became sweeter in their eyes even thanreturning home in their ships. as when some great forest fire is ragingupon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so as they marchedthe gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament of heaven.they were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plainabout the waters of cayster, that wing their way hither and thither,glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the fenis alive with their screaming. even thus did their tribes pour fromships and tents on to the plain of the scamander, and the ground rangas brass under the feet of men and horses. they stood as thick upon theflower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.as countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman's homestead in thetime of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so did theachaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the trojans and destroy them.the chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight began,drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when theyhave got mixed while feeding; and among them went king agamemnon, witha head and face like jove the lord of thunder, a waist like mars, and achest like that of neptune. as some great bull that lords it over theherds upon the plain, even so did jove make the son of atreus standpeerless among the multitude of heroes.and now, o muses, dwellers in the mansions of olympus, tell me--for youare goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things, whilewe know nothing but by report--who were the chiefs and princes of thedanaans? as for the common soldiers, they were so that i could not nameevery single one of them though i had ten tongues, and though my voicefailed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless you, oolympian muses, daughters of aegis-bearing jove, were to recount themto me. nevertheless, i will tell the captains of the ships and all thefleet together.peneleos, leitus, arcesilaus, prothoenor, and clonius were captains ofthe boeotians. these were they that dwelt in hyria and rocky aulis, andwho held schoenus, scolus, and the highlands of eteonus, with thespeia,graia, and the fair city of mycalessus. they also held harma, eilesium,and erythrae; and they had eleon, hyle, and peteon; ocalea and thestrong fortress of medeon; copae, eutresis, and thisbe the haunt ofdoves; coronea, and the pastures of haliartus; plataea and glisas; thefortress of thebes the less; holy onchestus with its famous grove ofneptune; arne rich in vineyards; midea, sacred nisa, and anthedon uponthe sea. from these there came fifty ships, and in each there were ahundred and twenty young men of the boeotians.ascalaphus and ialmenus, sons of mars, led the people that dwelt inaspledon and orchomenus the realm of minyas. astyoche a noble maidenbore them in the house of actor son of azeus; for she had gone withmars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. withthese there came thirty ships.the phoceans were led by schedius and epistrophus, sons of mightyiphitus the son of naubolus. these were they that held cyparissus,rocky pytho, holy crisa, daulis, and panopeus; they also that dwelt inanemorea and hyampolis, and about the waters of the river cephissus,and lilaea by the springs of the cephissus; with their chieftains cameforty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the phoceans, which werestationed next to the boeotians, on their left.ajax, the fleet son of oileus, commanded the locrians. he was not sogreat, nor nearly so great, as ajax the son of telamon. he was a littleman, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of the spear heexcelled all the hellenes and the achaeans. these dwelt in cynus,opous, calliarus, bessa, scarphe, fair augeae, tarphe, and throniumabout the river boagrius. with him there came forty ships of thelocrians who dwell beyond euboea.the fierce abantes held euboea with its cities, chalcis, eretria,histiaea rich in vines, cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perchedtown of dium; with them were also the men of carystus and styra;elephenor of the race of mars was in command of these; he was son ofchalcodon, and chief over all the abantes. with him they came, fleet offoot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would everstrive to tear open the corslets of their foes with their long ashenspears. of these there came fifty ships.and they that held the strong city of athens, the people of greaterechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but jove's daughter,minerva, fostered him, and established him at athens in her own richsanctuary. there, year by year, the athenian youths worship him withsacrifices of bulls and rams. these were commanded by menestheus, sonof peteos. no man living could equal him in the marshalling of chariotsand foot soldiers. nestor could alone rival him, for he was older. withhim there came fifty ships.ajax brought twelve ships from salamis, and stationed them alongsidethose of the athenians.the men of argos, again, and those who held the walls of tiryns, withhermione, and asine upon the gulf; troezene, eionae, and the vineyardlands of epidaurus; the achaean youths, moreover, who came from aeginaand mases; these were led by diomed of the loud battle-cry, andsthenelus son of famed capaneus. with them in command was euryalus, sonof king mecisteus, son of talaus; but diomed was chief over them all.with these there came eighty ships.those who held the strong city of mycenae, rich corinth and cleonae;orneae, araethyrea, and licyon, where adrastus reigned of old;hyperesia, high gonoessa, and pellene; aegium and all the coast-landround about helice; these sent a hundred ships under the command ofking agamemnon, son of atreus. his force was far both finest and mostnumerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all glorious in hisarmour of gleaming bronze--foremost among the heroes, for he was thegreatest king, and had most men under him.and those that dwelt in lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, pharis,sparta, with messe the haunt of doves; bryseae, augeae, amyclae, andhelos upon the sea; laas, moreover, and oetylus; these were led bymenelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to agamemnon, and of themthere were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others. among them wentmenelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for helonged to avenge the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the sakeof helen.the men of pylos and arene, and thryum where is the ford of the riveralpheus; strong aipy, cyparisseis, and amphigenea; pteleum, helos, anddorium, where the muses met thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy forever. he was returning from oechalia, where eurytus lived and reigned,and boasted that he would surpass even the muses, daughters ofaegis-bearing jove, if they should sing against him; whereon they wereangry, and maimed him. they robbed him of his divine power of song, andthenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. these were commanded bynestor, knight of gerene, and with him there came ninety ships.and those that held arcadia, under the high mountain of cyllene, nearthe tomb of aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men ofpheneus also, and orchomenus rich in flocks; of rhipae, stratie, andbleak enispe; of tegea and fair mantinea; of stymphelus and parrhasia;of these king agapenor son of ancaeus was commander, and they had sixtyships. many arcadians, good soldiers, came in each one of them, butagamemnon found them the ships in which to cross the sea, for they werenot a people that occupied their business upon the waters.the men, moreover, of buprasium and of elis, so much of it as isenclosed between hyrmine, myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock oleneand alesium. these had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships,with many epeans on board. their captains were amphimachus andthalpius--the one, son of cteatus, and the other, of eurytus--both ofthe race of actor. the two others were diores, son of amarynces, andpolyxenus, son of king agasthenes, son of augeas.and those of dulichium with the sacred echinean islands, who dweltbeyond the sea off elis; these were led by meges, peer of mars, and theson of valiant phyleus, dear to jove, who quarrelled with his father,and went to settle in dulichium. with him there came forty ships.ulysses led the brave cephallenians, who held ithaca, neritum with itsforests, crocylea, rugged aegilips, samos and zacynthus, with themainland also that was over against the islands. these were led byulysses, peer of jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve ships.thoas, son of andraemon, commanded the aetolians, who dwelt in pleuron,olenus, pylene, chalcis by the sea, and rocky calydon, for the greatking oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was alsogolden-haired meleager, who had been set over the aetolians to be theirking. and with thoas there came forty ships.the famous spearsman idomeneus led the cretans, who held cnossus, andthe well-walled city of gortys; lyctus also, miletus and lycastus thatlies upon the chalk; the populous towns of phaestus and rhytium, withthe other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of crete. all thesewere led by idomeneus, and by meriones, peer of murderous mars. andwith these there came eighty ships.tlepolemus, son of hercules, a man both brave and large of stature,brought nine ships of lordly warriors from rhodes. these dwelt inrhodes which is divided among the three cities of lindus, ielysus, andcameirus, that lies upon the chalk. these were commanded by tlepolemus,son of hercules by astyochea, whom he had carried off from ephyra, onthe river selleis, after sacking many cities of valiant warriors. whentlepolemus grew up, he killed his father's uncle licymnius, who hadbeen a famous warrior in his time, but was then grown old. on this hebuilt himself a fleet, gathered a great following, and fled beyond thesea, for he was menaced by the other sons and grandsons of hercules.after a voyage, during which he suffered great hardship, he came torhodes, where the people divided into three communities, according totheir tribes, and were dearly loved by jove, the lord of gods and men;wherefore the son of saturn showered down great riches upon them.and nireus brought three ships from syme--nireus, who was thehandsomest man that came up under ilius of all the danaans after theson of peleus--but he was a man of no substance, and had but a smallfollowing.and those that held nisyrus, crapathus, and casus, with cos, the cityof eurypylus, and the calydnian islands, these were commanded bypheidippus and antiphus, two sons of king thessalus the son ofhercules. and with them there came thirty ships.those again who held pelasgic argos, alos, alope, and trachis; andthose of phthia and hellas the land of fair women, who were calledmyrmidons, hellenes, and achaeans; these had fifty ships, over whichachilles was in command. but they now took no part in the war, inasmuchas there was no one to marshal them; for achilles stayed by his ships,furious about the loss of the girl briseis, whom he had taken fromlyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sacked lyrnessus andthebe, and had overthrown mynes and epistrophus, sons of king evenor,son of selepus. for her sake achilles was still grieving, but ere longhe was again to join them.and those that held phylace and the flowery meadows of pyrasus,sanctuary of ceres; iton, the mother of sheep; antrum upon the sea, andpteleum that lies upon the grass lands. of these brave protesilaus hadbeen captain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under theearth. he had left a wife behind him in phylace to tear her cheeks insorrow, and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by adardanian warrior while leaping foremost of the achaeans upon the soilof troy. still, though his people mourned their chieftain, they werenot without a leader, for podarces, of the race of mars, marshalledthem; he was son of iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son ofphylacus, and he was own brother to protesilaus, only younger,protesilaus being at once the elder and the more valiant. so the peoplewere not without a leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost.with him there came forty ships.and those that held pherae by the boebean lake, with boebe, glaphyrae,and the populous city of iolcus, these with their eleven ships were ledby eumelus, son of admetus, whom alcestis bore to him, loveliest of thedaughters of pelias.and those that held methone and thaumacia, with meliboea and ruggedolizon, these were led by the skilful archer philoctetes, and they hadseven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good archers; butphiloctetes was lying in great pain in the island of lemnos, where thesons of the achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a poisonouswater snake. there he lay sick and sorry, and full soon did the argivescome to miss him. but his people, though they felt his loss were notleaderless, for medon, the bastard son of oileus by rhene, set them inarray.those, again, of tricca and the stony region of ithome, and they thatheld oechalia, the city of oechalian eurytus, these were commanded bythe two sons of aesculapius, skilled in the art of healing, podaliriusand machaon. and with them there came thirty ships.the men, moreover, of ormenius, and by the fountain of hypereia, withthose that held asterius, and the white crests of titanus, these wereled by eurypylus, the son of euaemon, and with them there came fortyships.those that held argissa and gyrtone, orthe, elone, and the white cityof oloosson, of these brave polypoetes was leader. he was son ofpirithous, who was son of jove himself, for hippodameia bore him topirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountainsavages and drove them from mt. pelion to the aithices. but polypoeteswas not sole in command, for with him was leonteus, of the race ofmars, who was son of coronus, the son of caeneus. and with these therecame forty ships.guneus brought two and twenty ships from cyphus, and he was followed bythe enienes and the valiant peraebi, who dwelt about wintry dodona, andheld the lands round the lovely river titaresius, which sends itswaters into the peneus. they do not mingle with the silver eddies ofthe peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for the titaresius isa branch of dread orcus and of the river styx.of the magnetes, prothous son of tenthredon was commander. they werethey that dwelt about the river peneus and mt. pelion. prothous, fleetof foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.such were the chiefs and princes of the danaans. who, then, o muse, wasthe foremost, whether man or horse, among those that followed after thesons of atreus?of the horses, those of the son of pheres were by far the finest. theywere driven by eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. they were of thesame age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. apollo, of thesilver bow, had bred them in perea--both of them mares, and terrible asmars in battle. of the men, ajax, son of telamon, was much the foremostso long as achilles' anger lasted, for achilles excelled him greatlyand he had also better horses; but achilles was now holding aloof athis ships by reason of his quarrel with agamemnon, and his peoplepassed their time upon the sea shore, throwing discs or aiming withspears at a mark, and in archery. their horses stood each by his ownchariot, champing lotus and wild celery. the chariots were housed undercover, but their owners, for lack of leadership, wandered hither andthither about the host and went not forth to fight.thus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groanedbeneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the landabout typhoeus among the arimi, where they say typhoeus lies. even sodid the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.and now iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by jove to tell the bad newsamong the trojans. they were gathered in assembly, old and young, atpriam's gates, and iris came close up to priam, speaking with the voiceof priam's son polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed aswatchman for the trojans on the tomb of old aesyetes, to look out forany sally of the achaeans. in his likeness iris spoke, saying, \"oldman, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is at hand. i havebeen in many a battle, but never yet saw such a host as is nowadvancing. they are crossing the plain to attack the city as thick asleaves or as the sands of the sea. hector, i charge you above allothers, do as i say. there are many allies dispersed about the city ofpriam from distant places and speaking divers tongues. therefore, leteach chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally inarray and leading them forth to battle.\"thus she spoke, but hector knew that it was the goddess, and at oncebroke up the assembly. the men flew to arms; all the gates were opened,and the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the tramp asof a great multitude.now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon theplain. men call it batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb oflithe myrine. here the trojans and their allies divided their forces.priam's son, great hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded thetrojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and mostvaliant of those who were longing for the fray.the dardanians were led by brave aeneas, whom venus bore to anchises,when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountainslopes of ida. he was not alone, for with him were the two sons ofantenor, archilochus and acamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.they that dwelt in telea under the lowest spurs of mt. ida, men ofsubstance, who drink the limpid waters of the aesepus, and are oftrojan blood--these were led by pandarus son of lycaon, whom apollo hadtaught to use the bow.they that held adresteia and the land of apaesus, with pityeia, and thehigh mountain of tereia--these were led by adrestus and amphius, whosebreastplate was of linen. these were the sons of merops of percote, whoexcelled in all kinds of divination. he told them not to take part inthe war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to destruction.they that dwelt about percote and practius, with sestos, abydos, andarisbe--these were led by asius, son of hyrtacus, a bravecommander--asius, the son of hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark baysteeds, of the breed that comes from the river selleis, had broughtfrom arisbe.hippothous led the tribes of pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in fertilelarissa--hippothous, and pylaeus of the race of mars, two sons of thepelasgian lethus, son of teutamus.acamas and the warrior peirous commanded the thracians and those thatcame from beyond the mighty stream of the hellespont.euphemus, son of troezenus, the son of ceos, was captain of theciconian spearsmen.pyraechmes led the paeonian archers from distant amydon, by the broadwaters of the river axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.the paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted pylaemanes fromenetae, where the mules run wild in herds. these were they that heldcytorus and the country round sesamus, with the cities by the riverparthenius, cromna, aegialus, and lofty erithini.odius and epistrophus were captains over the halizoni from distantalybe, where there are mines of silver.chromis, and ennomus the augur, led the mysians, but his skill inaugury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by thehand of the fleet descendant of aeacus in the river, where he slewothers also of the trojans.phorcys, again, and noble ascanius led the phrygians from the farcountry of ascania, and both were eager for the fray.mesthles and antiphus commanded the meonians, sons of talaemenes, bornto him of the gygaean lake. these led the meonians, who dwelt under mt.tmolus.nastes led the carians, men of a strange speech. these held miletus andthe wooded mountain of phthires, with the water of the river maeanderand the lofty crests of mt. mycale. these were commanded by nastes andamphimachus, the brave sons of nomion. he came into the fight with goldabout him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was of no avail tosave him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the fleet descendantof aeacus, and achilles bore away his gold.sarpedon and glaucus led the lycians from their distant land, by theeddying waters of the xanthus.book iii  alexandria, also called paris, challenges menelaus--helen and  priam view the achaeans from the wall--the covenant--paris  and menelaus fight, and paris is worsted--venus carries him  off to save him--scene between him and helen.when the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain, thetrojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that screamoverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters ofoceanus to bring death and destruction on the pygmies, and they wranglein the air as they fly; but the achaeans marched silently, in highheart, and minded to stand by one another.as when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountaintops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a mancan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dustfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.when they were close up with one another, alexandrus came forward aschampion on the trojan side. on his shoulders he bore the skin of apanther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod withbronze as a challenge to the bravest of the achaeans to meet him insingle fight. menelaus saw him thus stride out before the ranks, andwas glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of some goat orhorned stag, and devours it there and then, though dogs and youths setupon him. even thus was menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight ofalexandrus, for he deemed that now he should be revenged. he sprang,therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit of armour.alexandrus quailed as he saw menelaus come forward, and shrank in fearof his life under cover of his men. as one who starts back affrighted,trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in somemountain glade, even so did alexandrus plunge into the throng of trojanwarriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son of atreus.then hector upbraided him. \"paris,\" said he, \"evil-hearted paris, fairto see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had neverbeen born, or that you had died unwed. better so, than live to bedisgraced and looked askance at. will not the achaeans mock at us andsay that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but who hasneither wit nor courage? did you not, such as you are, get yourfollowing together and sail beyond the seas? did you not from your afar country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people ofwarriors--to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and your wholecountry, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness toyourself? and now can you not dare face menelaus and learn what mannerof man he is whose wife you have stolen? where indeed would be yourlyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, whenyou were lying in the dust before him? the trojans are a weak-kneedpeople, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones for the wrongsyou have done them.\"and alexandrus answered, \"hector, your rebuke is just. you are hard asthe axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the timberto his liking. as the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of yourscorn. still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden venus has givenme; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the gods givethem where they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. ifyou would have me do battle with menelaus, bid the trojans and achaeanstake their seats, while he and i fight in their midst for helen and allher wealth. let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the betterman take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but letthe rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you trojans shallstay here in troy, while the others go home to argos and the land ofthe achaeans.\"when hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the trojanranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they allsat down at his bidding: but the achaeans still aimed at him withstones and arrows, till agamemnon shouted to them saying, \"hold,argives, shoot not, sons of the achaeans; hector desires to speak.\"they ceased taking aim and were still, whereon hector spoke. \"hear frommy mouth,\" said he, \"trojans and achaeans, the saying of alexandrus,through whom this quarrel has come about. he bids the trojans andachaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and menelaus fightin the midst of you for helen and all her wealth. let him who shall bevictorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all shehas, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a solemncovenant of peace.\"thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till menelaus of the loudbattle-cry addressed them. \"and now,\" he said, \"hear me too, for it isi who am the most aggrieved. i deem that the parting of achaeans andtrojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much have sufferedfor my quarrel with alexandrus and the wrong he did me. let him whoshall die, die, and let the others fight no more. bring, then, twolambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for earth and sun, and we willbring a third for jove. moreover, you shall bid priam come, that he mayswear to the covenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill totrust, and the oaths of jove must not be transgressed or taken in vain.young men's minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he looksbefore and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon both sides.\"the trojans and achaeans were glad when they heard this, for theythought that they should now have rest. they backed their chariotstoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying itdown upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with alittle space between them. hector sent two messengers to the city tobring the lambs and to bid priam come, while agamemnon told talthybiusto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as agamemnon hadsaid.meanwhile iris went to helen in the form of her sister-in-law, wife ofthe son of antenor, for helicaon, son of antenor, had married laodice,the fairest of priam's daughters. she found her in her own room,working at a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroideringthe battles between trojans and achaeans, that mars had made them fightfor her sake. iris then came close up to her and said, \"come hither,child, and see the strange doings of the trojans and achaeans. till nowthey have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but nowthey have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,sitting still with their spears planted beside them. alexandrus andmenelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to be the wifeof him who is the victor.\"thus spoke the goddess, and helen's heart yearned after her formerhusband, her city, and her parents. she threw a white mantle over herhead, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone, butattended by two of her handmaids, aethrae, daughter of pittheus, andclymene. and straightway they were at the scaean gates.the two sages, ucalegon and antenor, elders of the people, were seatedby the scaean gates, with priam, panthous, thymoetes, lampus, clytius,and hiketaon of the race of mars. these were too old to fight, but theywere fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrupdelicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. when they sawhelen coming towards the tower, they said softly to one another, \"smallwonder that trojans and achaeans should endure so much and so long, forthe sake of a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. still, fairthough she be, let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow forus and for our children after us.\"but priam bade her draw nigh. \"my child,\" said he, \"take your seat infront of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen and yourfriends. i lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you who are toblame. it is they that have brought about this terrible war with theachaeans. tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and goodly? ihave seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and so royal. surelyhe must be a king.\"\"sir,\" answered helen, \"father of my husband, dear and reverend in myeyes, would that i had chosen death rather than to have come here withyour son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling daughter,and all the companions of my girlhood. but it was not to be, and my lotis one of tears and sorrow. as for your question, the hero of whom youask is agamemnon, son of atreus, a good king and a brave soldier,brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserableself.\"the old man marvelled at him and said, \"happy son of atreus, child ofgood fortune. i see that the achaeans are subject to you in greatmultitudes. when i was in phrygia i saw much horsemen, the people ofotreus and of mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the riversangarius; i was their ally, and with them when the amazons, peers ofmen, came up against them, but even they were not so many as theachaeans.\"the old man next looked upon ulysses; \"tell me,\" he said, \"who is thatother, shorter by a head than agamemnon, but broader across the chestand shoulders? his armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks infront of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his ewes.\"and helen answered, \"he is ulysses, a man of great craft, son oflaertes. he was born in rugged ithaca, and excels in all manner ofstratagems and subtle cunning.\"on this antenor said, \"madam, you have spoken truly. ulysses once camehere as envoy about yourself, and menelaus with him. i received them inmy own house, and therefore know both of them by sight andconversation. when they stood up in presence of the assembled trojans,menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated ulysseshad the more royal presence. after a time they delivered their message,and the speech of menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not saymuch, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly and tothe point, though he was the younger man of the two; ulysses, on theother hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent and kept hiseyes fixed upon the ground. there was no play nor graceful movement ofhis sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man unpractised inoratory--one might have taken him for a mere churl or simpleton; butwhen he raised his voice, and the words came driving from his deepchest like winter snow before the wind, then there was none to touchhim, and no man thought further of what he looked like.\"priam then caught sight of ajax and asked, \"who is that great andgoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest ofthe argives?\"\"that,\" answered helen, \"is huge ajax, bulwark of the achaeans, and onthe other side of him, among the cretans, stands idomeneus looking likea god, and with the captains of the cretans round him. often didmenelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting usfrom crete. i see, moreover, many other achaeans whose names i couldtell you, but there are two whom i can nowhere find, castor, breaker ofhorses, and pollux the mighty boxer; they are children of my mother,and own brothers to myself. either they have not left lacedaemon, orelse, though they have brought their ships, they will not showthemselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that i have broughtupon them.\"she knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earthin their own land of lacedaemon.meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through thecity--two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and idaeusbrought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. he went up to priam andsaid, \"son of laomedon, the princes of the trojans and achaeans bid youcome down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant. alexandrusand menelaus are to fight for helen in single combat, that she and allher wealth may go with him who is the victor. we are to swear to asolemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell here in troy,while the achaeans return to argos and the land of the achaeans.\"the old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke thehorses, and they made all haste to do so. he mounted the chariot,gathered the reins in his hand, and antenor took his seat beside him;they then drove through the scaean gates on to the plain. when theyreached the ranks of the trojans and achaeans they left the chariot,and with measured pace advanced into the space between the hosts.agamemnon and ulysses both rose to meet them. the attendants brought onthe oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they pouredwater over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of atreus drew thedagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs' heads; thisthe men-servants gave about among the trojan and achaean princes, andthe son of atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. \"father jove,\" hecried, \"that rulest in ida, most glorious in power, and thou oh sun,that seest and givest ear to all things, earth and rivers, and ye whoin the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken his oath,witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain. ifalexandrus kills menelaus, let him keep helen and all her wealth, whilewe sail home with our ships; but if menelaus kills alexandrus, let thetrojans give back helen and all that she has; let them moreover paysuch fine to the achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony amongthose that shall be born hereafter. and if priam and his sons refusesuch fine when alexandrus has fallen, then will i stay here and fighton till i have got satisfaction.\"as he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, andlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife hadreft them of their strength. then they poured wine from the mixing-bowlinto the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, trojans andachaeans among one another, \"jove, most great and glorious, and yeother everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall firstsin against their oaths--of them and their children--may be shed uponthe ground even as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves ofstrangers.\"thus they prayed, but not as yet would jove grant them their prayer.then priam, descendant of dardanus, spoke, saying, \"hear me, trojansand achaeans, i will now go back to the wind-beaten city of ilius: idare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son andmenelaus, for jove and the other immortals alone know which shall fall.\"on this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. hegathered the reins in his hand, and antenor sat beside him; the twothen went back to ilius. hector and ulysses measured the ground, andcast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first.meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying,\"father jove, that rulest from ida, most glorious in power, grant thathe who first brought about this war between us may die, and enter thehouse of hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths.\"great hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet, andthe lot of paris flew out first. the others took their severalstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying,while alexandrus, husband of lovely helen, put on his goodly armour.first he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted withancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brotherlycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded swordof bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. on hiscomely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hairthat nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spearthat suited his hands. in like fashion menelaus also put on his armour.when they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierceof aspect into the open space, and both trojans and achaeans werestruck with awe as they beheld them. they stood near one another on themeasured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against theother. alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of the sonof atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned itspoint. menelaus next took aim, praying to father jove as he did so.\"king jove,\" he said, \"grant me revenge on alexandrus who has wrongedme; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrinkfrom doing ill deeds in the house of his host.\"he poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield ofalexandrus. through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt byhis flank, but alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. thenthe son of atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part ofhis helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces fromhis hand, and he cried, looking towards heaven, \"father jove, of allgods thou art the most despiteful; i made sure of my revenge, but thesword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and ihave not killed him.\"with this he flew at alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume ofhis helmet, and began dragging him towards the achaeans. the strap ofthe helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and menelaus wouldhave dragged him off to his own great glory had not jove's daughtervenus been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that theempty helmet came away in his hand. this he flung to his comrades amongthe achaeans, and was again springing upon alexandrus to run himthrough with a spear, but venus snatched him up in a moment (as a godcan do), hid him under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his ownbedchamber.then she went to call helen, and found her on a high tower with thetrojan women crowding round her. she took the form of an old woman whoused to dress wool for her when she was still in lacedaemon, and ofwhom she was very fond. thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robeand said, \"come hither; alexandrus says you are to go to the house; heis on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed ingorgeous apparel. no one would think he had just come from fighting,but rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and wassitting down.\"with these words she moved the heart of helen to anger. when she markedthe beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparklingeyes, she marvelled at her and said, \"goddess, why do you thus beguileme? are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom youhave taken up in phrygia or fair meonia? menelaus has just vanquishedalexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him. you are comehere to betray me. go sit with alexandrus yourself; henceforth begoddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to olympus; worryabout him and look after him till he make you his wife, or, for thematter of that, his slave--but me? i shall not go; i can garnish hisbed no longer; i should be a by-word among all the women of troy.besides, i have trouble on my mind.\"venus was very angry, and said, \"bold hussy, do not provoke me; if youdo, i shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as i have lovedyou. i will stir up fierce hatred between trojans and achaeans, and youshall come to a bad end.\"at this helen was frightened. she wrapped her mantle about her and wentin silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the trojan women.when they came to the house of alexandrus the maid-servants set abouttheir work, but helen went into her own room, and the laughter-lovinggoddess took a seat and set it for her facing alexandrus. on thishelen, daughter of aegis-bearing jove, sat down, and with eyes askancebegan to upbraid her husband.\"so you are come from the fight,\" said she; \"would that you had fallenrather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. you used tobrag that you were a better man with hands and spear than menelaus. go,then, and challenge him again--but i should advise you not to do so,for if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you willsoon fall by his spear.\"and paris answered, \"wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. thistime, with the help of minerva, menelaus has vanquished me; anothertime i may myself be victor, for i too have gods that will stand by me.come, let us lie down together and make friends. never yet was i sopassionately enamoured of you as at this moment--not even when i firstcarried you off from lacedaemon and sailed away with you--not even wheni had converse with you upon the couch of love in the island of cranaewas i so enthralled by desire of you as now.\" on this he led hertowards the bed, and his wife went with him.thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of atreusstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for alexandrus, and no man,neither of the trojans nor of the allies, could find him. if they hadseen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them hatedhim as they did death itself. then agamemnon, king of men, spoke,saying, \"hear me, trojans, dardanians, and allies. the victory has beenwith menelaus; therefore give back helen with all her wealth, and paysuch fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shallbe born hereafter.\"thus spoke the son of atreus, and the achaeans shouted in applause.book iv  a quarrel in olympus--minerva goes down and persuades fandarus  to violate the oaths by wounding menelaus with an arrow--agamemnon  makes a speech and sends for machaon--he then  goes about among his captains and upbraids ulysses and  sthenelus, who each of them retort fiercely--diomed checks  sthenelus, and the two hosts then engage, with great slaughter  on either side.now the gods were sitting with jove in council upon the golden floorwhile hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as theypledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon thetown of troy. the son of saturn then began to tease juno, talking ather so as to provoke her. \"menelaus,\" said he, \"has two good friendsamong the goddesses, juno of argos, and minerva of alalcomene, but theyonly sit still and look on, while venus keeps ever by alexandrus' sideto defend him in any danger; indeed she has just rescued him when hemade sure that it was all over with him--for the victory really did liewith menelaus. we must consider what we shall do about all this; shallwe set them fighting anew or make peace between them? if you will agreeto this last menelaus can take back helen and the city of priam mayremain still inhabited.\"minerva and juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by sidehatching mischief for the trojans. minerva scowled at her father, forshe was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but juno couldnot contain herself. \"dread son of saturn,\" said she, \"what, pray, isthe meaning of all this? is my trouble, then, to go for nothing, andthe sweat that i have sweated, to say nothing of my horses, whilegetting the people together against priam and his children? do as youwill, but we other gods shall not all of us approve your counsel.\"jove was angry and answered, \"my dear, what harm have priam and hissons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of ilius?will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat priamraw, with his sons and all the other trojans to boot? have it your ownway then; for i would not have this matter become a bone of contentionbetween us. i say further, and lay my saying to your heart, if ever iwant to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, you must not try tostop me; you will have to let me do it, for i am giving in to yousorely against my will. of all inhabited cities under the sun and starsof heaven, there was none that i so much respected as ilius with priamand his whole people. equitable feasts were never wanting about myaltar, nor the savour of burning fat, which is honour due to ourselves.\"\"my own three favourite cities,\" answered juno, \"are argos, sparta, andmycenae. sack them whenever you may be displeased with them. i shallnot defend them and i shall not care. even if i did, and tried to stayyou, i should take nothing by it, for you are much stronger than i am,but i will not have my own work wasted. i too am a god and of the samerace with yourself. i am saturn's eldest daughter, and am honourablenot on this ground only, but also because i am your wife, and you areking over the gods. let it be a case, then, of give-and-take betweenus, and the rest of the gods will follow our lead. tell minerva to goand take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that thetrojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon theachaeans.\"the sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to minerva, \"go atonce into the trojan and achaean hosts, and contrive that the trojansshall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the achaeans.\"this was what minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted fromthe topmost summits of olympus. she shot through the sky as somebrilliant meteor which the son of scheming saturn has sent as a sign tomariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows inits wake. the trojans and achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld,and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, \"either we shall againhave war and din of combat, or jove the lord of battle will now makepeace between us.\"thus did they converse. then minerva took the form of laodocus, son ofantenor, and went through the ranks of the trojans to find pandarus,the redoubtable son of lycaon. she found him standing among thestalwart heroes who had followed him from the banks of the aesopus, soshe went close up to him and said, \"brave son of lycaon, will you do asi tell you? if you dare send an arrow at menelaus you will win honourand thanks from all the trojans, and especially from princealexandrus--he would be the first to requite you very handsomely if hecould see menelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from yourhand. take your home aim then, and pray to lycian apollo, the famousarcher; vow that when you get home to your strong city of zelea youwill offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.\"his fool's heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case. thisbow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed as itwas bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen as thearrow struck it to the heart. its horns were sixteen palms long, and aworker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them well down, andgiving them tips of gold. when pandarus had strung his bow he laid itcarefully on the ground, and his brave followers held their shieldsbefore him lest the achaeans should set upon him before he had shotmenelaus. then he opened the lid of his quiver and took out a wingedarrow that had not yet been shot, fraught with the pangs of death. helaid the arrow on the string and prayed to lycian apollo, the famousarcher, vowing that when he got home to his strong city of zelea hewould offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour. he laid thenotch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drew both notch andstring to his breast till the arrow-head was near the bow; then whenthe bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, and the bow twanged,and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly on over the heads of thethrong.but the blessed gods did not forget thee, o menelaus, and jove'sdaughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee andward off the piercing arrow. she turned it from his skin as a motherwhisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly; she guidedit to the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed overhis double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt thatwent tightly round him. it went right through this and through thecuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it,which he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows; it was thisthat served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went throughit and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing from thewound.as when some woman of meonia or caria strains purple dye on to a pieceof ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be laid upin a treasure house--many a knight is fain to bear it, but the kingkeeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver may beproud--even so, o menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your legs downto your fair ancles stained with blood.when king agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was afraid,and so was brave menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs of thearrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft were stilloutside the wound. then he took heart, but agamemnon heaved a deep sighas he held menelaus's hand in his own, and his comrades made moan inconcert. \"dear brother,\" he cried, \"i have been the death of you inpledging this covenant and letting you come forward as our champion.the trojans have trampled on their oaths and have wounded you;nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings and theright hands of fellowship in which we have put our trust shall not bevain. if he that rules olympus fulfil it not here and now, he will yetfulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their lives andwith their wives and children. the day will surely come when mightyilius shall be laid low, with priam and priam's people, when the son ofsaturn from his high throne shall overshadow them with his awful aegisin punishment of their present treachery. this shall surely be; buthow, menelaus, shall i mourn you, if it be your lot now to die? ishould return to argos as a by-word, for the achaeans will at once gohome. we shall leave priam and the trojans the glory of still keepinghelen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie here at troy withyour purpose not fulfilled. then shall some braggart trojan leap uponyour tomb and say, 'ever thus may agamemnon wreak his vengeance; hebrought his army in vain; he is gone home to his own land with emptyships, and has left menelaus behind him.' thus will one of them say,and may the earth then swallow me.\"but menelaus reassured him and said, \"take heart, and do not alarm thepeople; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer beltof burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass and thebelt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me.\"and agamemnon answered, \"i trust, dear menelaus, that it may be evenso, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it torelieve your pain.\"he then said to talthybius, \"talthybius, tell machaon, son to the greatphysician, aesculapius, to come and see menelaus immediately. sometrojan or lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our dismay,and to his own great glory.\"talthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to findmachaon. presently he found standing amid the brave warriors who hadfollowed him from tricca; thereon he went up to him and said, \"son ofaesculapius, king agamemnon says you are to come and see menelausimmediately. some trojan or lycian archer has wounded him with an arrowto our dismay and to his own great glory.\"thus did he speak, and machaon was moved to go. they passed through thespreading host of the achaeans and went on till they came to the placewhere menelaus had been wounded and was lying with the chieftainsgathered in a circle round him. machaon passed into the middle of thering and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bending its barbs backthrough the force with which he pulled it out. he undid the burnishedbelt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt of mail which thebronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped awaythe blood and applied some soothing drugs which chiron had given toaesculapius out of the good will he bore him.while they were thus busy about menelaus, the trojans came forwardagainst them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed thefight.you would not have then found agamemnon asleep nor cowardly andunwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. he left his chariotrich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of eurymedon, son ofptolemaeus the son of peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readinessagainst the time his limbs should weary of going about and givingorders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. when he saw menhasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on. \"argives,\"said he, \"slacken not one whit in your onset; father jove will be nohelper of liars; the trojans have been the first to break their oathsand to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures; weshall take their city and carry off their wives and children in ourships.\"but he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined tofight. \"argives,\" he cried, \"cowardly miserable creatures, have you noshame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longerscud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight? you are asdazed and spiritless as deer. would you wait till the trojans reach thesterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see whether the son ofsaturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?\"thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. passing throughthe crowd, he came presently on the cretans, arming round idomeneus,who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while meriones wasbringing up the battalions that were in the rear. agamemnon was gladwhen he saw him, and spoke him fairly. \"idomeneus,\" said he, \"i treatyou with greater distinction than i do any others of the achaeans,whether in war or in other things, or at table. when the princes aremixing my choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them afixed allowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that youmay drink whenever you are minded. go, therefore, into battle, and showyourself the man you have been always proud to be.\"idomeneus answered, \"i will be a trusty comrade, as i promised you fromthe first i would be. urge on the other achaeans, that we may joinbattle at once, for the trojans have trampled upon their covenants.death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have been the firstto break their oaths and to attack us.\"the son of atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the twoajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. as when agoat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over the deepbefore the west wind--black as pitch is the offing and a mightywhirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flockinto a cave--even thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a darkmass to battle under the ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. glad wasking agamemnon when he saw them. \"no need,\" he cried, \"to give ordersto such leaders of the argives as you are, for of your own selves youspur your men on to fight with might and main. would, by father jove,minerva, and apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city ofpriam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it.\"with this he left them and went onward to nestor, the facile speaker ofthe pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in companywith pelagon, alastor, chromius, haemon, and bias shepherd of hispeople. he placed his knights with their chariots and horses in thefront rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom he couldtrust, were in the rear. the cowards he drove into the middle, thatthey might fight whether they would or no. he gave his orders to theknights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand, so as toavoid confusion. \"let no man,\" he said, \"relying on his strength orhorsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the trojans,nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your attack; but let eachwhen he meets an enemy's chariot throw his spear from his own; this bemuch the best; this is how the men of old took towns and strongholds;in this wise were they minded.\"thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight, andking agamemnon was glad. \"i wish,\" he said to him, \"that your limbswere as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age,the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that ithad fallen upon some other, and that you were still young.\"and nestor, knight of gerene, answered, \"son of atreus, i too wouldgladly be the man i was when i slew mighty ereuthalion; but the godswill not give us everything at one and the same time. i was then young,and now i am old; still i can go with my knights and give them thatcounsel which old men have a right to give. the wielding of the spear ileave to those who are younger and stronger than myself.\"agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found menestheus, sonof peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the athenians loudof tongue in battle. near him also tarried cunning ulysses, with hissturdy cephallenians round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry,for the ranks of trojans and achaeans had only just begun to move, sothey were standing still, waiting for some other columns of theachaeans to attack the trojans and begin the fighting. when he saw thisagamemnon rebuked them and said, \"son of peteos, and you other, steepedin cunning, heart of guile, why stand you here cowering and waiting onothers? you two should be of all men foremost when there is hardfighting to be done, for you are ever foremost to accept my invitationwhen we councillors of the achaeans are holding feast. you are gladenough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink wine as longas you please, whereas now you would not care though you saw tencolumns of achaeans engage the enemy in front of you.\"ulysses glared at him and answered, \"son of atreus, what are youtalking about? how can you say that we are slack? when the achaeans arein full fight with the trojans, you shall see, if you care to do so,that the father of telemachus will join battle with the foremost ofthem. you are talking idly.\"when agamemnon saw that ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly at himand withdrew his words. \"ulysses,\" said he, \"noble son of laertes,excellent in all good counsel, i have neither fault to find nor ordersto give you, for i know your heart is right, and that you and i are ofa mind. enough; i will make you amends for what i have said, and if anyill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing.\"he then left them and went on to others. presently he saw the son oftydeus, noble diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, withsthenelus the son of capaneus beside him; whereon he began to upbraidhim. \"son of tydeus,\" he said, \"why stand you cowering here upon thebrink of battle? tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever ahead of hismen when leading them on against the foe--so, at least, say they thatsaw him in battle, for i never set eyes upon him myself. they say thatthere was no man like him. he came once to mycenae, not as an enemy butas a guest, in company with polynices to recruit his forces, for theywere levying war against the strong city of thebes, and prayed ourpeople for a body of picked men to help them. the men of mycenae werewilling to let them have one, but jove dissuaded them by showing themunfavourable omens. tydeus, therefore, and polynices went their way.when they had got as far the deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of theaesopus, the achaeans sent tydeus as their envoy, and he found thecadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet in the house ofeteocles. stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding himselfsingle-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests of allkinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily didminerva help him. the cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set aforce of fifty youths with two captains--the godlike hero maeon, son ofhaemon, and polyphontes, son of autophonus--at their head, to lie inwait for him on his return journey; but tydeus slew every man of them,save only maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven's omens. suchwas tydeus of aetolia. his son can talk more glibly, but he cannotfight as his father did.\"diomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of agamemnon;but the son of capaneus took up his words and said, \"son of atreus,tell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. we boast ourselvesas even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated thebes, thoughthe wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number, for we trustedin the omens of the gods and in the help of jove, whereas they perishedthrough their own sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in likehonour with us.\"diomed looked sternly at him and said, \"hold your peace, my friend, asi bid you. it is not amiss that agamemnon should urge the achaeansforward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his theshame if we are vanquished. therefore let us acquit ourselves withvalour.\"as he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so fiercelyabout his body that even a brave man might well have been scared tohear it.as when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west windhas lashed it into fury--it has reared its head afar and now comescrashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over thejagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions--even so did theserried phalanxes of the danaans march steadfastly to battle. thechiefs gave orders each to his own people, but the men said never aword; no man would think it, for huge as the host was, it seemed asthough there was not a tongue among them, so silent were they in theirobedience; and as they marched the armour about their bodies glistenedin the sun. but the clamour of the trojan ranks was as that of manythousand ewes that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some richflockmaster, and bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating of theirlambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their tongues werediverse, and they came from many different places. these were inspiredof mars, but the others by minerva--and with them came panic, rout, andstrife whose fury never tires, sister and friend of murderous mars,who, from being at first but low in stature, grows till she uprears herhead to heaven, though her feet are still on earth. she it was thatwent about among them and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrowwith even hand between them.when they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield andspear with spear in the rage of battle. the bossed shields beat oneupon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude--death-cryand shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red withblood. as torrents swollen with rain course madly down their deepchannels till the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd onthe hillside hears their roaring from afar--even such was the toil anduproar of the hosts as they joined in battle.first antilochus slew an armed warrior of the trojans, echepolus, sonof thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. he struck at theprojecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; thepoint of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes;headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as hedropped king elephenor, son of chalcodon and captain of the proudabantes began dragging him out of reach of the darts that were fallingaround him, in haste to strip him of his armour. but his purpose wasnot for long; agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him in theside with his bronze-shod spear--for as he stooped his side was leftunprotected by his shield--and thus he perished. then the fight betweentrojans and achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew uponeach other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.forthwith ajax, son of telamon, slew the fair youth simoeisius, son ofanthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the simois, as she wascoming down from mt. ida, where she had been with her parents to seetheir flocks. therefore he was named simoeisius, but he did not live topay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off untimely by thespear of mighty ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right nippleas he was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear went rightthrough his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straightand tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with branches.then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that he may fashion afelloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it lies seasoning bythe waterside. in such wise did ajax fell to earth simoeisius, son ofanthemion. thereon antiphus of the gleaming corslet, son of priam,hurled a spear at ajax from amid the crowd and missed him, but he hitleucus, the brave comrade of ulysses, in the groin, as he was draggingthe body of simoeisius over to the other side; so he fell upon the bodyand loosed his hold upon it. ulysses was furious when he saw leucusslain, and strode in full armour through the front ranks till he wasquite close; then he glared round about him and took aim, and thetrojans fell back as he did so. his dart was not sped in vain, for itstruck democoon, the bastard son of priam, who had come to him fromabydos, where he had charge of his father's mares. ulysses, infuriatedby the death of his comrade, hit him with his spear on one temple, andthe bronze point came through on the other side of his forehead.thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and his armour rang rattling roundhim as he fell heavily to the ground. hector, and they that were infront, then gave round while the argives raised a shout and drew offthe dead, pressing further forward as they did so. but apollo lookeddown from pergamus and called aloud to the trojans, for he wasdispleased. \"trojans,\" he cried, \"rush on the foe, and do not letyourselves be thus beaten by the argives. their skins are not stone noriron that when hit them you do them no harm. moreover, achilles, theson of lovely thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at theships.\"thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while jove'sredoubtable daughter, the trito-born, went about among the host of theachaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them slackening.then fate fell upon diores, son of amarynceus, for he was struck by ajagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. he that hurled it waspeirous, son of imbrasus, captain of the thracians, who had come fromaenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the pitilessstone. he fell to the ground on his back, and in his death throesstretched out his hands towards his comrades. but peirous, who hadwounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into his belly, so thathis bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and darkness veiled hiseyes. as he was leaving the body, thoas of aetolia struck him in thechest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in his lungs. thoascame close up to him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and thendrawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that hedied; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his thraciancomrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads,stood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for allhis great stature and valour; so he was driven back. thus the twocorpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, the one captain ofthe thracians and the other of the epeans; and many another fell roundthem.and now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could havegone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with minerva leading himby the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows.for many trojans and achaeans on that day lay stretched side by sideface downwards upon the earth.book v  the exploits of diomed, who, though wounded by pandarus,  continues fighting--he kills pandarus and wounds aeneas--venus  rescues aeneas, but being wounded by diomed, commits him  to the care of apollo and goes to olympus, where she is tended  by her mother dione--mars encourages the trojans, and  aeneas returns to the fight cured of his wound--minerva and  juno help the achaeans, and by the advice of the former  diomed wounds mars, who returns to olympus to get cured.then pallas minerva put valour into the heart of diomed, son of tydeus,that he might excel all the other argives, and cover himself withglory. she made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet likethe star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in thewaters of oceanus--even such a fire did she kindle upon his head andshoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of thefight.now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the trojans,priest of vulcan, and his name was dares. he had two sons, phegeus andidaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. these two cameforward from the main body of trojans, and set upon diomed, he being onfoot, while they fought from their chariot. when they were close up toone another, phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over diomed'sleft shoulder without hitting him. diomed then threw, and his spearsped not in vain, for it hit phegeus on the breast near the nipple, andhe fell from his chariot. idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother'sbody, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would haveshared his brother's fate; whereon vulcan saved him by wrapping him ina cloud of darkness, that his old father might not be utterlyoverwhelmed with grief; but the son of tydeus drove off with thehorses, and bade his followers take them to the ships. the trojans werescared when they saw the two sons of dares, one of them in fright andthe other lying dead by his chariot. minerva, therefore, took mars bythe hand and said, \"mars, mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer ofcities, may we not now leave the trojans and achaeans to fight it out,and see to which of the two jove will vouchsafe the victory? let us goaway, and thus avoid his anger.\"so saying, she drew mars out of the battle, and set him down upon thesteep banks of the scamander. upon this the danaans drove the trojansback, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. first kingagamemnon flung mighty odius, captain of the halizoni, from hischariot. the spear of agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,just as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shouldersand went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling roundhim as he fell heavily to the ground.then idomeneus killed phaesus, son of borus the meonian, who had comefrom varne. mighty idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as hewas mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him ashe fell heavily from the car.the squires of idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while menelaus, sonof atreus, killed scamandrius the son of strophius, a mighty huntsmanand keen lover of the chase. diana herself had taught him how to killevery kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, butneither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for thespear of menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it struckhim between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that hefell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.meriones then killed phereclus the son of tecton, who was the son ofhermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunningworkmanship, for pallas minerva had dearly loved him. he it was thatmade the ships for alexandrus, which were the beginning of allmischief, and brought evil alike both on the trojans and on alexandrushimself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. meriones overtook himas he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. the point of thespear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon himas he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.meges, moreover, slew pedaeus, son of antenor, who, though he was abastard, had been brought up by theano as one of her own children, forthe love she bore her husband. the son of phyleus got close up to himand drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongueall among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in thedust.and eurypylus, son of euaemon, killed hypsenor, the son of nobledolopion, who had been made priest of the river scamander, and washonoured among the people as though he were a god. eurypylus gave himchase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon thearm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. the bloody hand fell tothe ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man canwithstand, came over his eyes.thus furiously did the battle rage between them. as for the son oftydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the achaeans or thetrojans. he rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that hasburst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitfulvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, butin a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste thatmany a strong man's hand has reclaimed--even so were the densephalanxes of the trojans driven in rout by the son of tydeus, and manythough they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.now when the son of lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving thetrojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front partof his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through themetal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered withblood. on this the son of lycaon shouted in triumph, \"knights trojans,come on; the bravest of the achaeans is wounded, and he will not holdout much longer if king apollo was indeed with me when i sped fromlycia hither.\"thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed diomed, who withdrewand made for the chariot and horses of sthenelus, the son of capaneus.\"dear son of capaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot, and drawthe arrow out of my shoulder.\"sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been madein his shirt. then diomed prayed, saying, \"hear me, daughter ofaegis-bearing jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well andstood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant meto come within a spear's throw of that man and kill him. he has beentoo quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that ishall not see the light of the sun much longer.\"thus he prayed, and pallas minerva heard him; she made his limbs suppleand quickened his hands and his feet. then she went up close to him andsaid, \"fear not, diomed, to do battle with the trojans, for i have setin your heart the spirit of your knightly father tydeus. moreover, ihave withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and menapart. if, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do notfight him; but should jove's daughter venus come, strike her with yourspear and wound her.\"when she had said this minerva went away, and the son of tydeus againtook his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierceeven than he had been before. he was like a lion that some mountainshepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wallof a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. the shepherd has roused the bruteto fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover ofthe buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, aresmothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leapsout over the sheep-yard wall. even thus did diomed go furiously aboutamong the trojans.he killed astynous, and hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one with athrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other witha sword-cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neckand back. he let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of abas andpolyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams eurydamas: they never cameback for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty diomed made anend of them. he then gave chase to xanthus and thoon, the two sons ofphaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out withage, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. but diomed tookboth their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for henevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen dividedhis wealth among themselves.then he came upon two sons of priam, echemmon and chromius, as theywere both in one chariot. he sprang upon them as a lion fastens on theneck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. forall their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot andstripped the armour from their bodies. then he gave their horses to hiscomrades to take them back to the ships.when aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went throughthe fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find pandarus.when he had found the brave son of lycaon he said, \"pandarus, where isnow your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, inrespect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in lyciathat can beat you? lift then your hands to jove and send an arrow atthis fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadlywork among the trojans. he has killed many a brave man--unless indeedhe is some god who is angry with the trojans about their sacrifices,and and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.\"and the son of lycaon answered, \"aeneas, i take him for none other thanthe son of tydeus. i know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet,and by his horses. it is possible that he may be a god, but if he isthe man i say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven'shelp, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud ofdarkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. i havetaken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrowwent through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and i made sure i shouldsend him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that i have notkilled him. there must be a god who is angry with me. moreover i haveneither horse nor chariot. in my father's stables there are elevenexcellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with clothsspread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,champing barley and rye; my old father lycaon urged me again and againwhen i was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots andhorses with me that i might lead the trojans in battle, but i would notlisten to him; it would have been much better if i had done so, but iwas thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill,and i was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might beill-fed, so i left them at home and came on foot to ilius armed onlywith my bow and arrows. these it seems, are of no use, for i havealready hit two chieftains, the sons of atreus and of tydeus, andthough i drew blood surely enough, i have only made them still morefurious. i did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day i led myband of trojans to ilius in hector's service, and if ever i get homeagain to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of myhouse, may some one cut my head off then and there if i do not breakthe bow and set it on a hot fire--such pranks as it plays me.\"aeneas answered, \"say no more. things will not mend till we two goagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial ofarms. mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of tros canspeed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. if joveagain vouchsafes glory to the son of tydeus they will carry us safelyback to the city. take hold, then, of the whip and reins while i standupon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man's onset while ilook after the horses.\"\"aeneas,\" replied the son of lycaon, \"take the reins and drive; if wehave to fly before the son of tydeus the horses will go better fortheir own driver. if they miss the sound of your voice when they expectit they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. theson of tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. thereforedrive them yourself and i will be ready for him with my spear.\"they then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son oftydeus. sthenelus, son of capaneus, saw them coming and said to diomed,\"diomed, son of tydeus, man after my own heart, i see two heroesspeeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilfularcher, pandarus son of lycaon, the other, aeneas, whose sire isanchises, while his mother is venus. mount the chariot and let usretreat. do not, i pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may getkilled.\"diomed looked angrily at him and answered: \"talk not of flight, for ishall not listen to you: i am of a race that knows neither flight norfear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. i am in no mind to mount, butwill go against them even as i am; pallas minerva bids me be afraid ofno man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not takeboth back again. i say further, and lay my saying to your heart--ifminerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay yourhorses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then besure you spring aeneas' horses and drive them from the trojan to theachaean ranks. they are of the stock that great jove gave to tros inpayment for his son ganymede, and are the finest that live and moveunder the sun. king anchises stole the blood by putting his mares tothem without laomedon's knowledge, and they bore him six foals. fourare still in his stables, but he gave the other two to aeneas. we shallwin great glory if we can take them.\"thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up tothem, and the son of lycaon spoke first. \"great and mighty son,\" saidhe, \"of noble tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so i will now trywith my spear.\"he poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. it struck theshield of the son of tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed ontill it reached the breastplate. thereon the son of lycaon shouted outand said, \"you are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand outfor long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\"but diomed all undismayed made answer, \"you have missed, not hit, andbefore you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shallglut tough-shielded mars with his blood.\"with this he hurled his spear, and minerva guided it on to pandarus'snose near the eye. it went crashing in among his white teeth; thebronze point cut through the root of his tongue, coming out under hischin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fellheavily to the ground. the horses started aside for fear, and he wasreft of life and strength.aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearinglest the achaeans should carry off the body. he bestrode it as a lionin the pride of strength, with shield and spear before him and a cry ofbattle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare facehim. but the son of tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and greatthat as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he boreit aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck aeneas on the groinwhere the hip turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\" thestone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jaggededges tore away all the flesh. the hero fell on his knees, and proppedhimself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of nightfell upon his eyes. and now aeneas, king of men, would have perishedthen and there, had not his mother, jove's daughter venus, who hadconceived him by anchises when he was herding cattle, been quick tomark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her dear son. sheprotected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lestsome danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. but the son ofcapaneus was not unmindful of the orders that diomed had given him. hemade his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding thereins to the rim of the chariot. then he sprang upon aeneas's horsesand drove them from the trojan to the achaean ranks. when he had sodone he gave them over to his chosen comrade deipylus, whom he valuedabove all others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, totake them on to the ships. he then remounted his own chariot, seizedthe reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of tydeus.now the son of tydeus was in pursuit of the cyprian goddess, spear inhand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses thatcan lord it among men in battle like minerva or enyo the waster ofcities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flewat her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. thepoint tore through the ambrosial robe which the graces had woven forher, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand,so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins of theblessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eatbread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and areimmortal. venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but phoebusapollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lestsome danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; anddiomed shouted out as he left her, \"daughter of jove, leave war andbattle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women? ifyou meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder at thevery name of war.\"the goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and iris, fleet as thewind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin allbesmirched. she found fierce mars waiting on the left of the battle,with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon shefell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her havehis horses. \"dear brother,\" she cried, \"save me, and give me yourhorses to take me to olympus where the gods dwell. i am badly woundedby a mortal, the son of tydeus, who would now fight even with fatherjove.\"thus she spoke, and mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. shemounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while iris sat beside herand took the reins in her hand. she lashed her horses on and they flewforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high olympus, wherethe gods have their dwelling. there she stayed them, unloosed them fromthe chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but venus flungherself on to the lap of her mother dione, who threw her arms about herand caressed her, saying, \"which of the heavenly beings has beentreating you in this way, as though you had been doing something wrongin the face of day?\"and laughter-loving venus answered, \"proud diomed, the son of tydeus,wounded me because i was bearing my dear son aeneas, whom i love bestof all mankind, out of the fight. the war is no longer one betweentrojans and achaeans, for the danaans have now taken to fighting withthe immortals.\"\"bear it, my child,\" replied dione, \"and make the best of it. wedwellers in olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, andwe lay much suffering on one another. mars had to suffer when otus andephialtes, children of aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he laythirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. mars would have thenperished had not fair eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of aloeus, toldmercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out bythe severity of his bondage. juno, again, suffered when the mighty sonof amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbedarrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. so, also, did huge hades,when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing jove, hit him with anarrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. thereon hades wentto the house of jove on great olympus, angry and full of pain; and thearrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till paeeonhealed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for hades was notof mortal mould. daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of hissin in shooting the gods that dwell in olympus. and now minerva hasegged this son of tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for notreflecting that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear hischildren prattling about his knees when he returns from battle. let,then, the son of tydeus see that he does not have to fight with one whois stronger than you are. then shall his brave wife aegialeia, daughterof adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss ofher wedded lord, diomed the bravest of the achaeans.\"so saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with bothhands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. but minervaand juno, who were looking on, began to taunt jove with their mockingtalk, and minerva was first to speak. \"father jove,\" said she, \"do notbe angry with me, but i think the cyprian must have been persuadingsome one of the achaean women to go with the trojans of whom she is sovery fond, and while caressing one or other of them she must have tornher delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman's brooch.\"the sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden venus to his side.\"my child,\" said he, \"it has not been given you to be a warrior.attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, andleave all this fighting to mars and to minerva.\"thus did they converse. but diomed sprang upon aeneas, though he knewhim to be in the very arms of apollo. not one whit did he fear themighty god, so set was he on killing aeneas and stripping him of hisarmour. thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him,and thrice did apollo beat back his gleaming shield. when he was comingon for the fourth time, as though he were a god, apollo shouted to himwith an awful voice and said, \"take heed, son of tydeus, and draw off;think not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earthcannot hold their own with the immortals.\"the son of tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the angerof the god, while apollo took aeneas out of the crowd and set him insacred pergamus, where his temple stood. there, within the mightysanctuary, latona and diana healed him and made him glorious to behold,while apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness ofaeneas, and armed as he was. round this the trojans and achaeans hackedat the bucklers about one another's breasts, hewing each other's roundshields and light hide-covered targets. then phoebus apollo said tomars, \"mars, mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, canyou not go to this man, the son of tydeus, who would now fight evenwith father jove, and draw him out of the battle? he first went up tothe cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and afterwardssprang upon me too, as though he were a god.\"he then took his seat on the top of pergamus, while murderous mars wentabout among the ranks of the trojans, cheering them on, in the likenessof fleet acamas chief of the thracians. \"sons of priam,\" said he, \"howlong will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the achaeans?would you wait till they are at the walls of troy? aeneas the son ofanchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as hectorhimself. help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from the stress ofthe fight.\"with these words he put heart and soul into them all. then sarpedonrebuked hector very sternly. \"hector,\" said he, \"where is your prowessnow? you used to say that though you had neither people nor allies youcould hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. i seenot one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it is we,your allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. i have come from afar,even from lycia and the banks of the river xanthus, where i have leftmy wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;nevertheless, i head my lycian soldiers and stand my ground against anywho would fight me though i have nothing here for the achaeans toplunder, while you look on, without even bidding your men stand firm indefence of their wives. see that you fall not into the hands of yourfoes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they sack your fair cityforthwith. keep this before your mind night and day, and beseech thecaptains of your allies to hold on without flinching, and thus put awaytheir reproaches from you.\"so spoke sarpedon, and hector smarted under his words. he sprang fromhis chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the hostbrandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising theterrible cry of battle. then they rallied and again faced the achaeans,but the argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back. asthe breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, whenmen are winnowing--while yellow ceres blows with the wind to sift thechaff from the grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter--evenso did the achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses' hoofs raisedto the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back tobattle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. fierce mars, tohelp the trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went abouteverywhere among them, inasmuch as phoebus apollo had told him thatwhen he saw pallas minerva leave the fray he was to put courage intothe hearts of the trojans--for it was she who was helping the danaans.then apollo sent aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled hisheart with valour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, whowere overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; butthey could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busywith the turmoil raised by mars and by strife, who raged insatiably intheir midst.the two ajaxes, ulysses and diomed, cheered the danaans on, fearless ofthe fury and onset of the trojans. they stood as still as clouds whichthe son of saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is noair and fierce boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whoseshrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions--even so did thedanaans stand firm and unflinching against the trojans. the son ofatreus went about among them and exhorted them. \"my friends,\" said he,\"quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another'seyes amid the stress of battle. they that shun dishonour more oftenlive than get killed, but they that fly save neither life nor name.\"as he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in thefront rank, the comrade of aeneas, deicoon son of pergasus, whom thetrojans held in no less honour than the sons of priam, for he was everquick to place himself among the foremost. the spear of king agamemnonstruck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed itnot. it drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, andhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.then aeneas killed two champions of the danaans, crethon andorsilochus. their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city ofphere and was descended from the river alpheus, whose broad streamflows through the land of the pylians. the river begat orsilochus, whoruled over much people and was father to diocles, who in his turn begattwin sons, crethon and orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war.these, when they grew up, went to ilius with the argive fleet in thecause of menelaus and agamemnon sons of atreus, and there they both ofthem fell. as two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of somemountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattletill they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two vanquishedby aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.brave menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to thefront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for marsegged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by aeneas;but antilochus the son of nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearingthat the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour tonothing; when, therefore aeneas and menelaus were setting their handsand spears against one another eager to do battle, antilochus placedhimself by the side of menelaus. aeneas, bold though he was, drew backon seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they drew thebodies of crethon and orsilochus to the ranks of the achaeans andcommitted the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. theythen turned back and fought in the front ranks.they killed pylaemenes peer of mars, leader of the paphlagonianwarriors. menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing onhis chariot, while antilochus hit his charioteer and squire mydon, theson of atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. he hit him witha stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fellfrom his hands into the dust. antilochus rushed towards him and struckhim on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from thechariot to the ground. there he stood for a while with his head andshoulders buried deep in the dust--for he had fallen on sandy soil tillhis horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as antilochuslashed them and drove them off to the host of the achaeans.but hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cryrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the trojans.mars and dread enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil ofbattle, while mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now infront of hector and now behind him.diomed shook with passion as he saw them. as a man crossing a wideplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great riverrolling swiftly to the sea--he sees its boiling waters and starts backin fear--even so did the son of tydeus give ground. then he said to hismen, \"my friends, how can we wonder that hector wields the spear sowell? some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now mars is withhim in the likeness of mortal man. keep your faces therefore towardsthe trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight withgods.\"as he spoke the trojans drew close up, and hector killed two men, bothin one chariot, menesthes and anchialus, heroes well versed in war.ajax son of telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up andhurled his spear, hitting amphius the son of selagus, a man of greatwealth who lived in paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but hislot had led him to come to the aid of priam and his sons. ajax struckhim in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and hefell heavily to the ground. then ajax ran towards him to strip him ofhis armour, but the trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fellupon his shield. he planted his heel upon the body and drew out hisspear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could notstrip the goodly armour from his shoulders. the trojan chieftains,moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so thathe dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drovehim from them and he was beaten back.thus, then, did the battle rage between them. presently the strong handof fate impelled tlepolemus, the son of hercules, a man both brave andof great stature, to fight sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson ofgreat jove, drew near to one another, and tlepolemus spoke first.\"sarpedon,\" said he, \"councillor of the lycians, why should you comeskulking here you who are a man of peace? they lie who call you son ofaegis-bearing jove, for you are little like those who were of old hischildren. far other was hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father,who came here for the horses of laomedon, and though he had six shipsonly, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of ilius and made awilderness of her highways. you are a coward, and your people arefalling from you. for all your strength, and all your coming fromlycia, you will be no help to the trojans but will pass the gates ofhades vanquished by my hand.\"and sarpedon, captain of the lycians, answered, \"tlepolemus, yourfather overthrew ilius by reason of laomedon's folly in refusingpayment to one who had served him well. he would not give your fatherthe horses which he had come so far to fetch. as for yourself, youshall meet death by my spear. you shall yield glory to myself, and yoursoul to hades of the noble steeds.\"thus spoke sarpedon, and tlepolemus upraised his spear. they threw atthe same moment, and sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of histhroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fellupon his eyes. tlepolemus's spear struck sarpedon on the left thighwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, buthis father as yet warded off destruction from him.his comrades bore sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by theweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. they were in suchhaste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing thespear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. meanwhile theachaeans carried off the body of tlepolemus, whereon ulysses was movedto pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. he doubted whetherto pursue the son of jove, or to make slaughter of the lycian rank andfile; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of jove;minerva, therefore, turned him against the main body of the lycians. hekilled coeranus, alastor, chromius, alcandrus, halius, noemon, andprytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great hector markedhim, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit of mail,filling the danaans with terror. sarpedon was glad when he saw himcoming, and besought him, saying, \"son of priam, let me not be here tofall into the hands of the danaans. help me, and since i may not returnhome to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me diewithin the walls of your city.\"hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon theachaeans and kill many among them. his comrades then bore sarpedon awayand laid him beneath jove's spreading oak tree. pelagon, his friend andcomrade, drew the spear out of his thigh, but sarpedon fainted and amist came over his eyes. presently he came to himself again, for thebreath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, andbrought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.meanwhile the argives were neither driven towards their ships by marsand hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that mars waswith the trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turnedtowards the foe. who, then, was first and who last to be slain by marsand hector? they were valiant teuthras, and orestes the renownedcharioteer, trechus the aetolian warrior, oenomaus, helenus the son ofoenops, and oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed of greatwealth, and dwelt by the cephisian lake with the other boeotians wholived near him, owners of a fertile country.now when the goddess juno saw the argives thus falling, she said tominerva, \"alas, daughter of aegis-bearing jove, unweariable, thepromise we made menelaus that he should not return till he had sackedthe city of ilius will be of no effect if we let mars rage thusfuriously. let us go into the fray at once.\"minerva did not gainsay her. thereon the august goddess, daughter ofgreat saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. hebe with allspeed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on eitherside of the iron axle-tree. the felloes of the wheels were of gold,imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze, wondrous tobehold. the naves of the wheels were silver, turning round the axleupon either side. the car itself was made with plaited bands of goldand silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round it. from thebody of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which shebound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under thenecks of the horses then juno put her steeds under the yoke, eager forbattle and the war-cry.meanwhile minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with herown hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the shirt of jove,arming herself for battle. she threw her tasselled aegis about hershoulders, wreathed round with rout as with a fringe, and on it werestrife, and strength, and panic whose blood runs cold; moreover therewas the head of the dread monster gorgon, grim and awful to behold,portent of aegis-bearing jove. on her head she set her helmet of gold,with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in front and behind--deckedwith the emblems of a hundred cities; then she stepped into her flamingchariot and grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, withwhich she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. junolashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flewopen of their own accord--gates over which the hours preside, in whosehands are heaven and olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hidesthem, or to close it. through these the goddesses drove their obedientsteeds, and found the son of saturn sitting all alone on the topmostridges of olympus. there juno stayed her horses, and spoke to jove theson of saturn, lord of all. \"father jove,\" said she, \"are you not angrywith mars for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of theachaeans he has destroyed to my great grief, and without either rightor reason, while the cyprian and apollo are enjoying it all at theirease and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. ihope, father jove, that you will not be angry if i hit mars hard, andchase him out of the battle.\"and jove answered, \"set minerva on to him, for she punishes him moreoften than any one else does.\"juno did as he had said. she lashed her horses, and they flew forwardnothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. as far as a man can see whenhe looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can theloud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. when theyreached troy and the place where its two flowing streams simois andscamander meet, there juno stayed them and took them from the chariot.she hid them in a thick cloud, and simois made ambrosia spring up forthem to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves intheir eagerness to help the argives. when they came to the part wherethe bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty diomed,fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,there juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voicedstentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together.\"argives,\" she cried; \"shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblanceonly; as long as achilles was fighting, if his spear was so deadly thatthe trojans dared not show themselves outside the dardanian gates, butnow they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships.\"with these words she put heart and soul into them all, while minervasprang to the side of the son of tydeus, whom she found near hischariot and horses, cooling the wound that pandarus had given him. forthe sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shieldirritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting upthe strap to wipe away the blood. the goddess laid her hand on the yokeof his horses and said, \"the son of tydeus is not such another as hisfather. tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madlyinto the fray even when i told him not to do so. when he went allunattended as envoy to the city of thebes among the cadmeans, i badehim feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spiritwhich was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of thecadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightilydid i help him. i stand by you too to protect you, and i bid you beinstant in fighting the trojans; but either you are tired out, or youare afraid and out of heart, and in that case i say that you are notrue son of tydeus the son of oeneus.\"diomed answered, \"i know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing jove,and will hide nothing from you. i am not afraid nor out of heart, noris there any slackness in me. i am only following your owninstructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but ifjove's daughter venus came into battle i was to wound her with myspear. therefore i am retreating, and bidding the other argives gatherin this place, for i know that mars is now lording it in the field.\"\"diomed, son of tydeus,\" replied minerva, \"man after my own heart, fearneither mars nor any other of the immortals, for i will befriend you.nay, drive straight at mars, and smite him in close combat; fear notthis raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then onthe other. but now he was holding talk with juno and myself, saying hewould help the argives and attack the trojans; nevertheless he is withthe trojans, and has forgotten the argives.\"with this she caught hold of sthenelus and lifted him off the charioton to the ground. in a second he was on the ground, whereupon thegoddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of diomed. theoaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and thehero; pallas minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight atmars. he was in the act of stripping huge periphas, son of ochesius andbravest of the aetolians. bloody mars was stripping him of his armour,and minerva donned the helmet of hades, that he might not see her;when, therefore, he saw diomed, he made straight for him and letperiphas lie where he had fallen. as soon as they were at closequarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke,thinking to take diomed's life, but minerva caught the spear in herhand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. diomed then threw,and pallas minerva drove the spear into the pit of mars's stomach wherehis under-girdle went round him. there diomed wounded him, tearing hisfair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. mars roared as loudlyas nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the achaeansand trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he raised.as a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even sodid diomed son of tydeus see mars ascend into the broad heavens. withall speed he reached high olympus, home of the gods, and in great painsat down beside jove the son of saturn. he showed jove the immortalblood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,\"father jove, are you not angered by such doings? we gods arecontinually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another's handswhile helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begottenthat mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage ofsome kind. we other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neitherscold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature isyour daughter. see how she has been inciting proud diomed to vent hisrage on the immortal gods. first he went up to the cyprian and woundedher in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me too asthough he were a god. had i not run for it i must either have lainthere for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpses, or havebeen eaten alive with spears till i had no more strength left in me.\"jove looked angrily at him and said, \"do not come whining here, sirfacing-both-ways. i hate you worst of all the gods in olympus, for youare ever fighting and making mischief. you have the intolerable andstubborn spirit of your mother juno: it is all i can do to manage her,and it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, i cannotlet you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own offspring, andit was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had beenthe son of any other god, you are so destructive that by this time youshould have been lying lower than the titans.\"he then bade paeeon heal him, whereon paeeon spread pain-killing herbsupon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. as thejuice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment thoughit is liquid, even so instantly did paeeon cure fierce mars. then hebewashed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat byhis father jove all glorious to behold.but juno of argos and minerva of alalcomene, now that they had put astop to the murderous doings of mars, went back again to the house ofjove.book vi  glaucus and diomed--the story of bellerophon--hector  and andromache.the fight between trojans and achaeans was now left to rage as itwould, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain asthey aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streamsof simois and xanthus.first, ajax son of telamon, tower of strength to the achaeans, broke aphalanx of the trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades bykilling acamas son of eussorus, the best man among the thracians, beingboth brave and of great stature. the spear struck the projecting peakof his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead into thebrain, and darkness veiled his eyes.then diomed killed axylus son of teuthranus, a rich man who lived inthe strong city of arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had ahouse by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeitnot one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and diomedkilled both him and his squire calesius, who was then hischarioteer--so the pair passed beneath the earth.euryalus killed dresus and opheltius, and then went in pursuit ofaesepus and pedasus, whom the naiad nymph abarbarea had borne to noblebucolion. bucolion was eldest son to laomedon, but he was a bastard.while tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and sheconceived twin sons; these the son of mecisteus now slew, and hestripped the armour from their shoulders. polypoetes then killedastyalus, ulysses pidytes of percote, and teucer aretaon. ablerus fellby the spear of nestor's son antilochus, and agamemnon, king of men,killed elatus who dwelt in pedasus by the banks of the river satnioeis.leitus killed phylacus as he was flying, and eurypylus slew melanthus.then menelaus of the loud war-cry took adrestus alive, for his horsesran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the plain,and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the city alongwith the others in full flight, but adrestus rolled out, and fell inthe dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot; menelaus came upto him spear in hand, but adrestus caught him by the knees begging forhis life. \"take me alive,\" he cried, \"son of atreus, and you shall havea full ransom for me: my father is rich and has much treasure of gold,bronze, and wrought iron laid by in his house. from this store he willgive you a large ransom should he hear of my being alive and at theships of the achaeans.\"thus did he plead, and menelaus was for yielding and giving him to asquire to take to the ships of the achaeans, but agamemnon came runningup to him and rebuked him. \"my good menelaus,\" said he, \"this is notime for giving quarter. has, then, your house fared so well at thehands of the trojans? let us not spare a single one of them--not eventhe child unborn and in its mother's womb; let not a man of them beleft alive, but let all in ilius perish, unheeded and forgotten.\"thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his wordswere just. menelaus, therefore, thrust adrestus from him, whereon kingagamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then the son of atreusplanted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear from the body.meanwhile nestor shouted to the argives, saying, \"my friends, danaanwarriors, servants of mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,and bring back much booty to the ships. let us kill as many as we can;the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them later atyour leisure.\"with these words he put heart and soul into them all. and now thetrojans would have been routed and driven back into ilius, had notpriam's son helenus, wisest of augurs, said to hector and aeneas,\"hector and aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the trojans andlycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in fight and counsel;hold your ground here, and go about among the host to rally them infront of the gates, or they will fling themselves into the arms oftheir wives, to the great joy of our foes. then, when you have putheart into all our companies, we will stand firm here and fight thedanaans however hard they press us, for there is nothing else to bedone. meanwhile do you, hector, go to the city and tell our mother whatis happening. tell her to bid the matrons gather at the temple ofminerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doorsof the sacred building; there, upon the knees of minerva, let her laythe largest, fairest robe she has in her house--the one she sets moststore by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve yearlingheifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of thegoddess, if she will take pity on the town, with the wives and littleones of the trojans, and keep the son of tydeus from falling on thegoodly city of ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men's soulswith panic. i hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear eventheir great champion achilles, son of a goddess though he be, as we dothis man: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie withhim in prowess.\"hector did as his brother bade him. he sprang from his chariot, andwent about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears, urgingthe men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle. thereon theyrallied and again faced the achaeans, who gave ground and ceased theirmurderous onset, for they deemed that some one of the immortals hadcome down from starry heaven to help the trojans, so strangely had theyrallied. and hector shouted to the trojans, \"trojans and allies, bemen, my friends, and fight with might and main, while i go to ilius andtell the old men of our council and our wives to pray to the gods andvow hecatombs in their honour.\"with this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went roundhis shield beat against his neck and his ancles.then glaucus son of hippolochus, and the son of tydeus went into theopen space between the hosts to fight in single combat. when they wereclose up to one another diomed of the loud war-cry was the first tospeak. \"who, my good sir,\" said he, \"who are you among men? i havenever seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond allothers if you abide my onset. woe to those fathers whose sons face mymight. if, however, you are one of the immortals and have come downfrom heaven, i will not fight you; for even valiant lycurgus, son ofdryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the gods. he itwas that drove the nursing women who were in charge of frenzied bacchusthrough the land of nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the ground asmurderous lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. bacchus himself plungedterror-stricken into the sea, and thetis took him to her bosom tocomfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which the man reviledhim. thereon the gods who live at ease were angry with lycurgus and theson of saturn struck him blind, nor did he live much longer after hehad become hateful to the immortals. therefore i will not fight withthe blessed gods; but if you are of them that eat the fruit of theground, draw near and meet your doom.\"and the son of hippolochus answered, \"son of tydeus, why ask me of mylineage? men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees. thoseof autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns theforest buds forth with fresh vines. even so is it with the generationsof mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away. if, then,you would learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many. thereis a city in the heart of argos, pasture land of horses, called ephyra,where sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind. he was theson of aeolus, and had a son named glaucus, who was father tobellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing comelinessand beauty. but proetus devised his ruin, and being stronger than he,drove him from the land of the argives, over which jove had made himruler. for antea, wife of proetus, lusted after him, and would have hadhim lie with her in secret; but bellerophon was an honourable man andwould not, so she told lies about him to proteus. 'proetus,' said she,'kill bellerophon or die, for he would have had converse with meagainst my will.' the king was angered, but shrank from killingbellerophon, so he sent him to lycia with lying letters ofintroduction, written on a folded tablet, and containing much illagainst the bearer. he bade bellerophon show these letters to hisfather-in-law, to the end that he might thus perish; bellerophontherefore went to lycia, and the gods convoyed him safely.\"when he reached the river xanthus, which is in lycia, the kingreceived him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nineheifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon thetenth day, he questioned him and desired to see the letter from hisson-in-law proetus. when he had received the wicked letter he firstcommanded bellerophon to kill that savage monster, the chimaera, whowas not a human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of a lionand the tail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and shebreathed forth flames of fire; but bellerophon slew her, for he wasguided by signs from heaven. he next fought the far-famed solymi, andthis, he said, was the hardest of all his battles. thirdly, he killedthe amazons, women who were the peers of men, and as he was returningthence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; he pickedthe bravest warriors in all lycia, and placed them in ambuscade, butnot a man ever came back, for bellerophon killed every one of them.then the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god, sohe kept him in lycia, gave him his daughter in marriage, and made himof equal honour in the kingdom with himself; and the lycians gave him apiece of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards andtilled fields, to have and to hold.\"the king's daughter bore bellerophon three children, isander,hippolochus, and laodameia. jove, the lord of counsel, lay withlaodameia, and she bore him noble sarpedon; but when bellerophon cameto be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate and dismayed uponthe alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, and shunning the path ofman. mars, insatiate of battle, killed his son isander while he wasfighting the solymi; his daughter was killed by diana of the goldenreins, for she was angered with her; but hippolochus was father tomyself, and when he sent me to troy he urged me again and again tofight ever among the foremost and outvie my peers, so as not to shamethe blood of my fathers who were the noblest in ephyra and in alllycia. this, then, is the descent i claim.\"thus did he speak, and the heart of diomed was glad. he planted hisspear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. \"then,\" hesaid, \"you are an old friend of my father's house. great oeneus onceentertained bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchangedpresents. oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and bellerophon a doublecup, which i left at home when i set out for troy. i do not remembertydeus, for he was taken from us while i was yet a child, when the armyof the achaeans was cut to pieces before thebes. henceforth, however, imust be your host in middle argos, and you mine in lycia, if i shouldever go there; let us avoid one another's spears even during a generalengagement; there are many noble trojans and allies whom i can kill, ifi overtake them and heaven delivers them into my hand; so again withyourself, there are many achaeans whose lives you may take if you can;we two, then, will exchange armour, that all present may know of theold ties that subsist between us.\"with these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one another'shands, and plighted friendship. but the son of saturn made glaucus takeleave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for bronze, the worthof a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.now when hector reached the scaean gates and the oak tree, the wivesand daughters of the trojans came running towards him to ask aftertheir sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set aboutpraying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.presently he reached the splendid palace of king priam, adorned withcolonnades of hewn stone. in it there were fifty bedchambers--all ofhewn stone--built near one another, where the sons of priam slept, eachwith his wedded wife. opposite these, on the other side the courtyard,there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for priam's daughters,built near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their wives.when hector got there, his fond mother came up to him with laodice thefairest of her daughters. she took his hand within her own and said,\"my son, why have you left the battle to come hither? are the achaeans,woe betide them, pressing you hard about the city that you have thoughtfit to come and uplift your hands to jove from the citadel? wait till ican bring you wine that you may make offering to jove and to the otherimmortals, and may then drink and be refreshed. wine gives a man freshstrength when he is wearied, as you now are with fighting on behalf ofyour kinsmen.\"and hector answered, \"honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unman meand i forget my strength. i dare not make a drink-offering to jove withunwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and filth may notpray to the son of saturn. get the matrons together, and go withofferings to the temple of minerva driver of the spoil; there, upon theknees of minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in yourhouse--the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to sacrificetwelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in thetemple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, with the wivesand little ones of the trojans, and keep the son of tydeus from off thegoodly city of ilius, for he fights with fury, and fills men's soulswith panic. go, then, to the temple of minerva, while i seek paris andexhort him, if he will hear my words. would that the earth might openher jaws and swallow him, for jove bred him to be the bane of thetrojans, and of priam and priam's sons. could i but see him go downinto the house of hades, my heart would forget its heaviness.\"his mother went into the house and called her waiting-women whogathered the matrons throughout the city. she then went down into herfragrant store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the work ofsidonian women, whom alexandrus had brought over from sidon when hesailed the seas upon that voyage during which he carried off helen.hecuba took out the largest robe, and the one that was most beautifullyenriched with embroidery, as an offering to minerva: it glittered likea star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. with this she went onher way and many matrons with her.when they reached the temple of minerva, lovely theano, daughter ofcisseus and wife of antenor, opened the doors, for the trojans had madeher priestess of minerva. the women lifted up their hands to thegoddess with a loud cry, and theano took the robe to lay it upon theknees of minerva, praying the while to the daughter of great jove.\"holy minerva,\" she cried, \"protectress of our city, mighty goddess,break the spear of diomed and lay him low before the scaean gates. dothis, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers that have never yet knownthe goad, in your temple, if you will have pity upon the town, with thewives and little ones of the trojans.\" thus she prayed, but pallasminerva granted not her prayer.while they were thus praying to the daughter of great jove, hector wentto the fair house of alexandrus, which he had built for him by theforemost builders in the land. they had built him his house,storehouse, and courtyard near those of priam and hector on theacropolis. here hector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in hishand; the bronze point gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to theshaft of the spear by a ring of gold. he found alexandrus within thehouse, busied about his armour, his shield and cuirass, and handlinghis curved bow; there, too, sat argive helen with her women, settingthem their several tasks; and as hector saw him he rebuked him withwords of scorn. \"sir,\" said he, \"you do ill to nurse this rancour; thepeople perish fighting round this our town; you would yourself chideone whom you saw shirking his part in the combat. up then, or ere longthe city will be in a blaze.\"and alexandrus answered, \"hector, your rebuke is just; listentherefore, and believe me when i tell you that i am not here so muchthrough rancour or ill-will towards the trojans, as from a desire toindulge my grief. my wife was even now gently urging me to battle, andi hold it better that i should go, for victory is ever fickle. wait,then, while i put on my armour, or go first and i will follow. i shallbe sure to overtake you.\"hector made no answer, but helen tried to soothe him. \"brother,\" saidshe, \"to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind had caughtme up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had borne me to somemountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that should have swept meaway ere this mischief had come about. but, since the gods have devisedthese evils, would, at any rate, that i had been wife to a betterman--to one who could smart under dishonour and men's evil speeches.this fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nor never will be, andhe will surely reap what he has sown. still, brother, come in and restupon this seat, for it is you who bear the brunt of that toil that hasbeen caused by my hateful self and by the sin of alexandrus--both ofwhom jove has doomed to be a theme of song among those that shall beborn hereafter.\"and hector answered, \"bid me not be seated, helen, for all the goodwillyou bear me. i cannot stay. i am in haste to help the trojans, who missme greatly when i am not among them; but urge your husband, and of hisown self also let him make haste to overtake me before i am out of thecity. i must go home to see my household, my wife and my little son,for i know not whether i shall ever again return to them, or whetherthe gods will cause me to fill by the hands of the achaeans.\"then hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. he did notfind andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of hermaids, weeping bitterly. seeing, then, that she was not within, hestood on the threshold of the women's rooms and said, \"women, tell me,and tell me true, where did andromache go when she left the house? wasit to my sisters, or to my brothers' wives? or is she at the temple ofminerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?\"his good housekeeper answered, \"hector, since you bid me tell youtruly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers' wives, noryet to the temple of minerva, where the other women are propitiatingthe awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of ilius, for she hadheard the trojans were being hard pressed, and that the achaeans werein great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the nursewent with her carrying the child.\"hector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went downthe streets by the same way that he had come. when he had gone throughthe city and had reached the scaean gates through which he would go outon to the plain, his wife came running towards him, andromache,daughter of great eetion who ruled in thebe under the wooded slopes ofmt. placus, and was king of the cilicians. his daughter had marriedhector, and now came to meet him with a nurse who carried his littlechild in her bosom--a mere babe. hector's darling son, and lovely as astar. hector had named him scamandrius, but the people called himastyanax, for his father stood alone as chief guardian of ilius. hectorsmiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak, and andromachestood by him weeping and taking his hand in her own. \"dear husband,\"said she, \"your valour will bring you to destruction; think on yourinfant son, and on my hapless self who ere long shall be yourwidow--for the achaeans will set upon you in a body and kill you. itwould be better for me, should i lose you, to lie dead and buried, fori shall have nothing left to comfort me when you are gone, save onlysorrow. i have neither father nor mother now. achilles slew my fatherwhen he sacked thebe the goodly city of the cilicians. he slew him, butdid not for very shame despoil him; when he had burned him in hiswondrous armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the mountainnymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing jove, planted a grove of elms abouthis tomb. i had seven brothers in my father's house, but on the sameday they all went within the house of hades. achilles killed them asthey were with their sheep and cattle. my mother--her who had beenqueen of all the land under mt. placus--he brought hither with thespoil, and freed her for a great sum, but the archer-queen diana tookher in the house of your father. nay--hector--you who to me are father,mother, brother, and dear husband--have mercy upon me; stay here uponthis wall; make not your child fatherless, and your wife a widow; asfor the host, place them near the fig-tree, where the city can be bestscaled, and the wall is weakest. thrice have the bravest of them comethither and assailed it, under the two ajaxes, idomeneus, the sons ofatreus, and the brave son of tydeus, either of their own bidding, orbecause some soothsayer had told them.\"and hector answered, \"wife, i too have thought upon all this, but withwhat face should i look upon the trojans, men or women, if i shirkedbattle like a coward? i cannot do so: i know nothing save to fightbravely in the forefront of the trojan host and win renown alike for myfather and myself. well do i know that the day will surely come whenmighty ilius shall be destroyed with priam and priam's people, but igrieve for none of these--not even for hecuba, nor king priam, nor formy brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust before theirfoes--for none of these do i grieve as for yourself when the day shallcome on which some one of the achaeans shall rob you for ever of yourfreedom, and bear you weeping away. it may be that you will have to plythe loom in argos at the bidding of a mistress, or to fetch water fromthe springs messeis or hypereia, treated brutally by some crueltask-master; then will one say who sees you weeping, 'she was wife tohector, the bravest warrior among the trojans during the war beforeilius.' on this your tears will break forth anew for him who would haveput away the day of captivity from you. may i lie dead under the barrowthat is heaped over my body ere i hear your cry as they carry you intobondage.\"he stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and nestledin his nurse's bosom, scared at the sight of his father's armour, andat the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his helmet. hisfather and mother laughed to see him, but hector took the helmet fromhis head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. then he took hisdarling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his arms, praying overhim the while to jove and to all the gods. \"jove,\" he cried, \"grantthat this my child may be even as myself, chief among the trojans; lethim be not less excellent in strength, and let him rule ilius with hismight. then may one say of him as he comes from battle, 'the son is farbetter than the father.' may he bring back the blood-stained spoils ofhim whom he has laid low, and let his mother's heart be glad.\"with this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who took himto her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. as her husbandwatched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed her fondly,saying, \"my own wife, do not take these things too bitterly to heart.no one can hurry me down to hades before my time, but if a man's houris come, be he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him whenhe has once been born. go, then, within the house, and busy yourselfwith your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering ofyour servants; for war is man's matter, and mine above all others ofthem that have been born in ilius.\"he took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back againto her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towards him. whenshe reached her home she found her maidens within, and bade them alljoin in her lament; so they mourned hector in his own house though hewas yet alive, for they deemed that they should never see him returnsafe from battle, and from the furious hands of the achaeans.paris did not remain long in his house. he donned his goodly armouroverlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast as his feetcould take him. as a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallopsgloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to bathe in thefair-flowing river--he holds his head high, and his mane streams uponhis shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies like the wind tothe haunts and feeding ground of the mares--even so went forth parisfrom high pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and helaughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way. forthwith he came upon hisbrother hector, who was then turning away from the place where he hadheld converse with his wife, and he was himself the first to speak.\"sir,\" said he, \"i fear that i have kept you waiting when you are inhaste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me.\"\"my good brother,\" answered hector, \"you fight bravely, and no man withany justice can make light of your doings in battle. but you arecareless and wilfully remiss. it grieves me to the heart to hear theill that the trojans speak about you, for they have suffered much onyour account. let us be going, and we will make things right hereafter,should jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of our deliverance beforeever-living gods of heaven in our own homes, when we have chased theachaeans from troy.\"book vii  hector and ajax fight--hector is getting worsted when night  comes on and parts them--they exchange presents--the  burial of the dead, and the building of a wall round their  ships by the achaeans--the achaeans buy their wine of  agamemnon and menelaus.with these words hector passed through the gates, and his brotheralexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. as when heaven sends abreeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and havelaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so welcomewas the sight of these two heroes to the trojans.thereon alexandrus killed menesthius the son of areithous; he lived inarne, and was son of areithous the mace-man, and of phylomedusa. hectorthrew a spear at eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in the neckunder the bronze rim of his helmet. glaucus, moreover, son ofhippolochus, captain of the lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight smoteiphinous son of dexius on the shoulder, as he was springing on to hischariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell to earth from the car, andthere was no life left in him.when, therefore, minerva saw these men making havoc of the argives, shedarted down to ilius from the summits of olympus, and apollo, who waslooking on from pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted thetrojans to be victorious. the pair met by the oak tree, and king apolloson of jove was first to speak. \"what would you have,\" said he,\"daughter of great jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hitherfrom olympus? have you no pity upon the trojans, and would you inclinethe scales of victory in favour of the danaans? let me persuadeyou--for it will be better thus--stay the combat for to-day, but letthem renew the fight hereafter till they compass the doom of ilius,since you goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.\"and minerva answered, \"so be it, far-darter; it was in this mind that icame down from olympus to the trojans and achaeans. tell me, then, howdo you propose to end this present fighting?\"apollo, son of jove, replied, \"let us incite great hector to challengesome one of the danaans in single combat; on this the achaeans will beshamed into finding a man who will fight him.\"minerva assented, and helenus son of priam divined the counsel of thegods; he therefore went up to hector and said, \"hector son of priam,peer of gods in counsel, i am your brother, let me then persuade you.bid the other trojans and achaeans all of them take their seats, andchallenge the best man among the achaeans to meet you in single combat.i have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour of yourdoom is not yet come.\"hector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among thetrojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and theyall sat down. agamemnon also bade the achaeans be seated. but minervaand apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father jove's highoak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together,bristling with shield and helmet and spear. as when the rising westwind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark beneath it, sosat the companies of trojans and achaeans upon the plain. and hectorspoke thus:--\"hear me, trojans and achaeans, that i may speak even as i am minded;jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing,and foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers oftroy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. the princes of theachaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him, then, that willfight me stand forward as your champion against hector. thus i say, andmay jove be witness between us. if your champion slay me, let him stripme of my armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my bodyhome that the trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire wheni am dead. in like manner, if apollo vouchsafe me glory and i slay yourchampion, i will strip him of his armour and take it to the city ofilius, where i will hang it in the temple of apollo, but i will give uphis body, that the achaeans may bury him at their ships, and the buildhim a mound by the wide waters of the hellespont. then will one sayhereafter as he sails his ship over the sea, 'this is the monument ofone who died long since a champion who was slain by mighty hector.'thus will one say, and my fame shall not be lost.\"thus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to declinethe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last menelaus rose andrebuked them, for he was angry. \"alas,\" he cried, \"vain braggarts,women forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us ifno man of the danaans will now face hector. may you be turned every manof you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious inyour places. i will myself go out against this man, but the upshot ofthe fight will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.\"with these words he put on his armour; and then, o menelaus, your lifewould have come to an end at the hands of hands of hector, for he wasfar better the man, had not the princes of the achaeans sprung upon youand checked you. king agamemnon caught him by the right hand and said,\"menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. be patient in spite ofpassion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourselfas hector son of priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.even achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank frommeeting him in battle. sit down your own people, and the achaeans willsend some other champion to fight hector; fearless and fond of battlethough he be, i ween his knees will bend gladly under him if he comesout alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.\"with these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.then nestor rose and spoke, \"of a truth,\" said he, \"the achaean land isfallen upon evil times. the old knight peleus, counsellor and oratoramong the myrmidons, loved when i was in his house to question meconcerning the race and lineage of all the argives. how would it notgrieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before hector? many atime would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave hisbody and go down within the house of hades. would, by father jove,minerva, and apollo, that i were still young and strong as when thepylians and arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river celadonunder the walls of pheia, and round about the waters of the riveriardanus. the godlike hero ereuthalion stood forward as their champion,with the armour of king areithous upon his shoulders--areithous whommen and women had surnamed 'the mace-man,' because he fought neitherwith bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his ironmace. lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him ina narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for lycurgus wastoo quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell toearth on his back. lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which marshad given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when he grewold and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire ereuthalion,who in this same armour challenged the foremost men among us. theothers quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight him thoughnone other would venture; i was the youngest man of them all; but wheni fought him minerva vouchsafed me victory. he was the biggest andstrongest man that ever i killed, and covered much ground as he laysprawling upon the earth. would that i were still young and strong as ithen was, for the son of priam would then soon find one who would facehim. but you, foremost among the whole host though you be, have none ofyou any stomach for fighting hector.\"thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started totheir feet. foremost of all uprose king agamemnon, and after him bravediomed the son of tydeus. next were the two ajaxes, men clothed invalour as with a garment, and then idomeneus, and meriones his brotherin arms. after these eurypylus son of euaemon, thoas the son ofandraemon, and ulysses also rose. then nestor knight of gerene againspoke, saying: \"cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. if hecome alive out of this fight he will have done good service alike tohis own soul and to the achaeans.\"thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrownit into the helmet of agamemnon son of atreus, the people lifted theirhands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into thevault of heaven, \"father jove, grant that the lot fall on ajax, or onthe son of tydeus, or upon the king of rich mycene himself.\"as they were speaking, nestor knight of gerene shook the helmet, andfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted--the lot of ajax. theherald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of theachaeans, going from left to right; but they none of them owned it.when, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon itand had put it into the helmet, brave ajax held out his hand, and theherald gave him the lot. when ajax saw his mark he knew it and wasglad; he threw it to the ground and said, \"my friends, the lot is mine,and i rejoice, for i shall vanquish hector. i will put on my armour;meanwhile, pray to king jove in silence among yourselves that thetrojans may not hear you--or aloud if you will, for we fear no man.none shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for i was bornand bred in salamis, and can hold my own in all things.\"with this they fell praying to king jove the son of saturn, and thuswould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, \"fatherjove that rulest from ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory toajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to hector alsoand would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\"thus they prayed, and ajax armed himself in his suit of gleamingbronze. when he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous marswhen he takes part among men whom jove has set fighting with oneanother--even so did huge ajax, bulwark of the achaeans, spring forwardwith a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long spear andstrode onward. the argives were elated as they beheld him, but thetrojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of hector beatquickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranksbehind him, for he had been the challenger. ajax came up bearing hisshield in front of him like a wall--a shield of bronze with seven foldsof oxhide--the work of tychius, who lived in hyle and was by far thebest worker in leather. he had made it with the hides of seven full-fedbulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. holdingthis shield before him, ajax son of telamon came close up to hector,and menaced him saying, \"hector, you shall now learn, man to man, whatkind of champions the danaans have among them even besides lion-heartedachilles cleaver of the ranks of men. he now abides at the ships inanger with agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of uswho are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight.\"and hector answered, \"noble ajax, son of telamon, captain of the host,treat me not as though i were some puny boy or woman that cannot fight.i have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. i am quickto turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this i deem themain thing in battle. i can charge among the chariots and horsemen, andin hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of mars; howbeit i wouldnot take such a man as you are off his guard--but i will smite youopenly if i can.\"he poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. it struck thesevenfold shield in its outermost layer--the eighth, which was ofbronze--and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide itstayed. then ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield of theson of priam. the terrible spear went through his gleaming shield, andpressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it piercedthe shirt against his side, but he swerved and thus saved his life.they then each of them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell onone another like savage lions or wild boars of great strength andendurance: the son of priam struck the middle of ajax's shield, but thebronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned. ajax thensprang forward and pierced the shield of hector; the spear went throughit and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack; it gashedhis neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but even so hectordid not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his brawny hand seizeda stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the plain; with this hestruck the shield of ajax on the boss that was in its middle, so thatthe bronze rang again. but ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone,swung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. this millstone ofa rock broke hector's shield inwards and threw him down on his backwith the shield crushing him under it, but apollo raised him at once.thereon they would have hacked at one another in close combat withtheir swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, comeforward, one from the trojans and the other from theachaeans--talthybius and idaeus both of them honourable men; theseparted them with their staves, and the good herald idaeus said, \"mysons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are dearto jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests ofnight may not be well gainsaid.\"ajax son of telamon answered, \"idaeus, bid hector say so, for it was hethat challenged our princes. let him speak first and i will accept hissaying.\"then hector said, \"ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature andstrength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all othersof the achaeans. let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we willfight anew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or tothe other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not bewell gainsaid. gladden, then, the hearts of the achaeans at your ships,and more especially those of your own followers and clansmen, while i,in the great city of king priam, bring comfort to the trojans and theirwomen, who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf. let us,moreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the achaeans andtrojans, 'they fought with might and main, but were reconciled andparted in friendship.'\"on this he gave ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath andleathern baldric, and in return ajax gave him a girdle dyed withpurple. thus they parted, the one going to the host of the achaeans,and the other to that of the trojans, who rejoiced when they saw theirhero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mightyajax. they led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been savedbeyond their hopes. on the other side the achaeans brought ajax elatedwith victory to agamemnon.when they reached the quarters of the son of atreus, agamemnonsacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of jove the son ofsaturn. they flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it intojoints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting themon the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off.when they had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it,and every man had his full and equal share, so that all were satisfied,and king agamemnon gave ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin,as a mark of special honour. as soon as they had had enough to eat anddrink, old nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; withall sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:--\"son of atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the achaeansare now dead, whose blood mars has shed by the banks of the scamander,and their souls have gone down to the house of hades, it will be wellwhen morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheelour dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from theships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comradeshome to their children. hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrowthat shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let usset about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships, andlet it have well-made gates that there may be a way through them forour chariots. close outside we will dig a deep trench all round it tokeep off both horse and foot, that the trojan chieftains may not bearhard upon us.\"thus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. meanwhile thetrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis bythe gates of king priam's palace; and wise antenor spoke. \"hear me,\" hesaid, \"trojans, dardanians, and allies, that i may speak even as i amminded. let us give up argive helen and her wealth to the sons ofatreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn covenants,and shall not prosper till we have done as i say.\"he then sat down and alexandrus husband of lovely helen rose to speak.\"antenor,\" said he, \"your words are not to my liking; you can find abetter saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken ingood earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason. i willspeak plainly, and hereby notify to the trojans that i will not give upthe woman; but the wealth that i brought home with her from argos iwill restore, and will add yet further of my own.\"on this, when paris had spoken and taken his seat, priam of the race ofdardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity andgoodwill addressed them thus: \"hear me, trojans, dardanians, andallies, that i may speak even as i am minded. get your suppers now ashitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful. atdaybreak let idaeus go to the ships, and tell agamemnon and menelaussons of atreus the saying of alexandrus through whom this quarrel hascome about; and let him also be instant with them that they now ceasefighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, tillheaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other.\"thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. they took supperin their companies and at daybreak idaeus went his way to the ships. hefound the danaans, servants of mars, in council at the stern ofagamemnon's ship, and took his place in the midst of them. \"son ofatreus,\" he said, \"and princes of the achaean host, priam and the othernoble trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of alexandrus throughwhom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find itacceptable. all the treasure he took with him in his ships totroy--would that he had sooner perished--he will restore, and will addyet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife ofmenelaus, though the trojans would have him do so. priam bade meinquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn our dead;hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us and givevictory to one or to the other.\"they all held their peace, but presently diomed of the loud war-cryspoke, saying, \"let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yethelen, for even a child may see that the doom of the trojans is athand.\"the sons of the achaeans shouted applause at the words that diomed hadspoken, and thereon king agamemnon said to idaeus, \"idaeus, you haveheard the answer the achaeans make you-and i with them. but asconcerning the dead, i give you leave to burn them, for when men areonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. let jovethe mighty husband of juno be witness to this covenant.\"as he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, andidaeus went back to the strong city of ilius. the trojans anddardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he came,he stood in their midst and delivered his message. as soon as theyheard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gather thecorpses, and others to bring in wood. the argives on their part alsohastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and others tobring in wood.the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into thevault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep oceanus, when thetwo armies met. they could hardly recognise their dead, but they washedthe clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted themupon their waggons. priam had forbidden the trojans to wail aloud, sothey heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and havingburned them went back to the city of ilius. the achaeans in like mannerheaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burnedthem went back to their ships.now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of theachaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that wasraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall toshelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates thatthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outsideit they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within withstakes.thus did the achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of jovethe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but neptune, lordof the earthquake, spoke, saying, \"father jove, what mortal in thewhole world will again take the gods into his counsel? see you not howthe achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trenchall round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? the fame of thiswall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no longer thinkanything of the one which phoebus apollo and myself built with so muchlabour for laomedon.\"jove was displeased and answered, \"what, o shaker of the earth, are youtalking about? a god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed atwhat they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself.surely when the achaeans have gone home with their ships, you canshatter their wall and fling it into the sea; you can cover the beachwith sand again, and the great wall of the achaeans will then beutterly effaced.\"thus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the achaeans wascompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got theirsupper. many ships had come with wine from lemnos, sent by euneus theson of jason, born to him by hypsipyle. the son of jason freighted themwith ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to the sonsof atreus, agamemnon and menelaus. from this supply the achaeans boughttheir wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides, somewith whole heifers, and some again with captives. they spread a goodlybanquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did the trojansand their allies in the city. but all the time jove boded them ill androared with his portentous thunder. pale fear got hold upon them, andthey spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground, nor did anydare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty son of saturn.then they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.book viii  jove forbids the gods to interfere further--there is an even  fight till midday, but then jove inclines the scales of victory  in favour of the trojans, who eventually chase the achaeans  within their wall--juno and minerva set out to help the  trojans: jove sends iris to turn them back, but later on  he promises juno that she shall have her way in the end--hector's  triumph is stayed by nightfall--the trojans bivouac on the plain.now when morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuselight over the earth, jove called the gods in council on the topmostcrest of serrated olympus. then he spoke and all the other gods gaveear. \"hear me,\" said he, \"gods and goddesses, that i may speak even asi am minded. let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross me,but obey me every one of you that i may bring this matter to an end. ifi see anyone acting apart and helping either trojans or danaans, heshall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to olympus; or iwill hurl him down into dark tartarus far into the deepest pit underthe earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as farbeneath hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may learn howmuch the mightiest i am among you. try me and find out for yourselves.hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you,gods and goddesses together--tug as you will, you will not drag jovethe supreme counsellor from heaven to earth; but were i to pull at itmyself i should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, thenwould i bind the chain about some pinnacle of olympus and leave you alldangling in the mid firmament. so far am i above all others either ofgods or men.\"they were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he hadspoken masterfully; but at last minerva answered, \"father, son ofsaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to begainsaid, but we are also sorry for the danaan warriors, who areperishing and coming to a bad end. we will, however, since you so bidus, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceablesuggestions to the argives that they may not all of them perish in yourdispleasure.\"jove smiled at her and answered, \"take heart, my child, trito-born; iam not really in earnest, and i wish to be kind to you.\"with this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes ofglittering gold. he girded himself also with gold about the body,seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. thereon helashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt earthand starry heaven. after a while he reached many-fountained ida, motherof wild beasts, and gargarus, where are his grove and fragrant altar.there the father of gods and men stayed his horses, took them from thechariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he took his seat allglorious upon the topmost crests, looking down upon the city of troyand the ships of the achaeans.the achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, andafterwards put on their armour. the trojans on the other hand likewisearmed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but neverthelesseager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. all the gateswere flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with the trampas of a great multitude.when they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield,and spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. mighty was thedin as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another--death--cry andshout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with blood.now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weaponsbeat against one another, and the people fell, but when the sun hadreached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and puttwo fates of death within them, one for the trojans and the other forthe achaeans. he took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted itup the day of the achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of theachaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of the trojans roseheavenwards. then he thundered aloud from ida, and sent the glare ofhis lightning upon the achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fellupon them and they were sore afraid.idomeneus dared not stay nor yet agamemnon, nor did the two ajaxes,servants of mars, hold their ground. nestor knight of gerene alonestood firm, bulwark of the achaeans, not of his own will, but one ofhis horses was disabled. alexandrus husband of lovely helen had hit itwith an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins to growaway from the skull, a very deadly place. the horse bounded in hisanguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw othersinto confusion. the old man instantly began cutting the traces with hissword, but hector's fleet horses bore down upon him through the routwith their bold charioteer, even hector himself, and the old man wouldhave perished there and then had not diomed been quick to mark, andwith a loud cry called ulysses to help him.\"ulysses,\" he cried, \"noble son of laertes where are you flying to,with your back turned like a coward? see that you are not struck with aspear between the shoulders. stay here and help me to defend nestorfrom this man's furious onset.\"ulysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of theachaeans, and the son of tydeus flinging himself alone into the thickof the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of neleus.\"sir,\" said he, \"these young warriors are pressing you hard, your forceis spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and yourhorses are slow to move. mount my chariot and see what the horses oftros can do--how cleverly they can scud hither and thither over theplain either in flight or in pursuit. i took them from the hero aeneas.let our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us drive minestraight at the trojans, that hector may learn how furiously i too canwield my spear.\"nestor knight of gerene hearkened to his words. thereon the doughtysquires, sthenelus and kind-hearted eurymedon, saw to nestor's horses,while the two both mounted diomed's chariot. nestor took the reins inhis hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up withhector, and the son of tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was chargingfull speed towards them. he missed him, but struck his charioteer andsquire eniopeus son of noble thebaeus in the breast by the nipple whilethe reins were in his hands, so that he died there and then, and thehorses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. hector was greatlygrieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie for all hissorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his steedshave to go long without one, for he presently found brave archeptolemusthe son of iphitus, and made him get up behind the horses, giving thereins into his hand.all had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have beenpenned up in ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men beenquick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell justin front of diomed's horses with a flare of burning brimstone. thehorses were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while thereins dropped from nestor's hands. then he was afraid and said todiomed, \"son of tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see you not thatthe hand of jove is against you? to-day he vouchsafes victory tohector; to-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant it toourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of jove, forhe is far stronger than any.\"diomed answered, \"all that you have said is true; there is a griefhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for hector will talk amongthe trojans and say, 'the son of tydeus fled before me to the ships.'this is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow me.\"\"son of tydeus,\" replied nestor, \"what mean you? though hector say thatyou are a coward the trojans and dardanians will not believe him, noryet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.\"so saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,and with a cry that rent the air the trojans and hector rained theirdarts after them. hector shouted to him and said, \"son of tydeus, thedanaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at table,the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.henceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than awoman. be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale ourwalls through any flinching upon my part; neither shall you carry offour wives in your ships, for i shall kill you with my own hand.\"the son of tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horsesround again and fight him. thrice did he doubt, and thrice did jovethunder from the heights of ida in token to the trojans that he wouldturn the battle in their favour. hector then shouted to them and said,\"trojans, lycians, and dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men, myfriends, and fight with might and with main; i see that jove is mindedto vouchsafe victory and great glory to myself, while he will dealdestruction upon the danaans. fools, for having thought of buildingthis weak and worthless wall. it shall not stay my fury; my horses willspring lightly over their trench, and when i am at their ships forgetnot to bring me fire that i may burn them, while i slaughter theargives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the smoke.\"then he cried to his horses, \"xanthus and podargus, and you aethon andgoodly lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweetcorn with which andromache daughter of great eetion has fed you, andfor she has mixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would,before doing so even for me who am her own husband. haste in pursuit,that we may take the shield of nestor, the fame of which ascends toheaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods and all, and that we maystrip from the shoulders of diomed the cuirass which vulcan made him.could we take these two things, the achaeans would set sail in theirships this self-same night.\"thus did he vaunt, but queen juno made high olympus quake as she shookwith rage upon her throne. then said she to the mighty god of neptune,\"what now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? can you find nocompassion in your heart for the dying danaans, who bring you many awelcome offering to helice and to aegae? wish them well then. if all ofus who are with the danaans were to drive the trojans back and keepjove from helping them, he would have to sit there sulking alone onida.\"king neptune was greatly troubled and answered, \"juno, rash of tongue,what are you talking about? we other gods must not set ourselvesagainst jove, for he is far stronger than we are.\"thus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch, fromthe ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors, whowere pent up there by hector son of priam, now that the hand of jovewas with him. he would even have set fire to the ships and burned them,had not queen juno put it into the mind of agamemnon, to bestir himselfand to encourage the achaeans. to this end he went round the ships andtents carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the hugeblack hull of ulysses' ship, which was middlemost of all; it was fromthis place that his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand towardsthe tents of ajax son of telamon, and on the other towards those ofachilles--for these two heroes, well assured of their own strength, hadvalorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line. from thisspot then, with a voice that could be heard afar, he shouted to thedanaans, saying, \"argives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave insemblance only; where are now our vaunts that we should provevictorious--the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in lemnos, when we atethe flesh of horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? youvowed that you would each of you stand against a hundred or two hundredmen, and now you prove no match even for one--for hector, who will beere long setting our ships in a blaze. father jove, did you ever soruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? yet, when tomy sorrow i was coming hither, i never let my ship pass your altarswithout offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every one ofthem, so eager was i to sack the city of troy. vouchsafe me then thisprayer--suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and let not theachaeans be so utterly vanquished by the trojans.\"thus did he pray, and father jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him thathis people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle, mostunfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its talons;the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the achaeanssacrificed to jove the lord of omens; when, therefore, the people sawthat the bird had come from jove, they sprang more fiercely upon thetrojans and fought more boldly.there was no man of all the many danaans who could then boast that hehad driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight soonerthan the son of tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew anarmed warrior of the trojans, agelaus the son of phradmon. he hadturned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the backmidway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and hisarmour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot.after him came agamemnon and menelaus, sons of atreus, the two ajaxesclothed in valour as with a garment, idomeneus and his companion inarms meriones, peer of murderous mars, and eurypylus the brave son ofeuaemon. ninth came teucer with his bow, and took his place under coverof the shield of ajax son of telamon. when ajax lifted his shieldteucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng, theman would fall dead; then teucer would hie back to ajax as a child toits mother, and again duck down under his shield.which of the trojans did brave teucer first kill? orsilochus, and thenormenus and ophelestes, daetor, chromius, and godlike lycophontes,amopaon son of polyaemon, and melanippus. all these in turn did he laylow upon the earth, and king agamemnon was glad when he saw him makinghavoc of the trojans with his mighty bow. he went up to him and said,\"teucer, man after my own heart, son of telamon, captain among thehost, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the danaans and the gloryof your father telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in hisown house when you were a child, bastard though you were. cover himwith glory though he is far off; i will promise and i will assuredlyperform; if aegis-bearing jove and minerva grant me to sack the city ofilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after my own--atripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go upinto your bed.\"and teucer answered, \"most noble son of atreus, you need not urge me;from the moment we began to drive them back to ilius, i have neverceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom i can shoot andkill; i have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buriedin the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog i cannot hit.\"as he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at hector, for he was benton hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit priam'sbrave son gorgythion in the breast. his mother, fair castianeira,lovely as a goddess, had been married from aesyme, and now he bowed hishead as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by showersin spring--even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight of hishelmet.again he aimed at hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again hisarrow missed, for apollo turned it aside; but he hit hector's bravecharioteer archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he wasdriving furiously into the fight. the horses swerved aside as he fellheadlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him. hectorwas greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for all hissorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother cebriones,who was hard by, take the reins. cebriones did as he had said. hectorthereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the ground, andseizing a great stone made straight for teucer with intent to kill him.teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid it upon thebow-string, but hector struck him with the jagged stone as he wastaking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him justwhere the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a very deadlyplace, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist was less, andthe bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward on his knees. ajax sawthat his brother had fallen, and running towards him bestrode him andsheltered him with his shield. meanwhile his two trusty squires,mecisteus son of echius, and alastor, came up and bore him to the shipsgroaning in his great pain.jove now again put heart into the trojans, and they drove the achaeansto their deep trench with hector in all his glory at their head. as ahound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives himchase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did hector followclose upon the achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as they rushedpanic-stricken onwards. when they had fled through the set stakes andtrench and many achaeans had been laid low at the hands of the trojans,they halted at their ships, calling upon one another and praying everyman instantly as they lifted up their hands to the gods; but hectorwheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring like those ofgorgo or murderous mars.juno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to minerva,\"alas, child of aegis-bearing jove, shall you and i take no morethought for the dying danaans, though it be the last time we ever doso? see how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but asingle man. hector the son of priam rages with intolerable fury, andhas already done great mischief.\"minerva answered, \"would, indeed, this fellow might die in his ownland, and fall by the hands of the achaeans; but my father jove is madwith spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. he forgetshow often i saved his son when he was worn out by the labourseurystheus had laid on him. he would weep till his cry came up toheaven, and then jove would send me down to help him; if i had had thesense to foresee all this, when eurystheus sent him to the house ofhades, to fetch the hell-hound from erebus, he would never have comeback alive out of the deep waters of the river styx. and now jove hatesme, while he lets thetis have her way because she kissed his knees andtook hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do honour toachilles. i shall know what to do next time he begins calling me hisgrey-eyed darling. get our horses ready, while i go within the house ofaegis-bearing jove and put on my armour; we shall then find out whetherpriam's son hector will be glad to meet us in the highways of battle,or whether the trojans will glut hounds and vultures with the fat oftheir flesh as they be dead by the ships of the achaeans.\"thus did she speak and white-armed juno, daughter of great saturn,obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds,while minerva daughter of aegis-bearing jove flung her richly vesture,made with her own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donnedthe shirt of jove, arming herself for battle. then she stepped into herflaming chariot, and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strongwith which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. junolashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew openof their own accord--gates over which the hours preside, in whose handsare heaven and olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides themor to close it. through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.but father jove when he saw them from ida was very angry, and sentwinged iris with a message to them. \"go,\" said he, \"fleet iris, turnthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come tofighting there will be mischief. this is what i say, and this is what imean to do. i will lame their horses for them; i will hurl them fromtheir chariot, and will break it in pieces. it will take them all tenyears to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them; mygrey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her fathermeans. i am less surprised and angry with juno, for whatever i say shealways contradicts me.\"with this iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights of idato the lofty summits of olympus. she met the goddesses at the outergates of its many valleys and gave them her message. \"what,\" said she,\"are you about? are you mad? the son of saturn forbids going. this iswhat he says, and this is what he means to do, he will lame your horses foryou, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break it in pieces.it will take you all ten years to heal the wounds his lightning willinflict upon you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess, whatquarrelling with your father means. he is less hurt and angry withjuno, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you, boldhussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in defiance ofjove?\"with this she left them, and juno said to minerva, \"of a truth, childof aegis-bearing jove, i am not for fighting men's battles further indefiance of jove. let them live or die as luck will have it, and letjove mete out his judgements upon the trojans and danaans according tohis own pleasure.\"she turned her steeds; the hours presently unyoked them, made them fastto their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the end wallof the courtyard. the two goddesses then sat down upon their goldenthrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were very angry.presently father jove drove his chariot to olympus, and entered theassembly of gods. the mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horsesfor him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. jovethen sat down upon his golden throne and olympus reeled beneath him.minerva and juno sat alone, apart from jove, and neither spoke norasked him questions, but jove knew what they meant, and said, \"minervaand juno, why are you so angry? are you fatigued with killing so manyof your dear friends the trojans? be this as it may, such is the mightof my hands that all the gods in olympus cannot turn me; you were bothof you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its terribledoings. i tell you therefore-and it would have surely been--i shouldhave struck you with lightning, and your chariots would never havebrought you back again to olympus.\"minerva and juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and broodedmischief for the trojans. minerva sat silent without a word, for shewas in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father; butjuno could not contain herself and said, \"what, dread son of saturn,are you talking about? we know how great your power is, nevertheless wehave compassion upon the danaan warriors who are perishing and comingto a bad end. we will, however, since you so bid us, refrain fromactual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to theargives, that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\"and jove answered, \"to-morrow morning, juno, if you choose to do so,you will see the son of saturn destroying large numbers of the argives,for fierce hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the sonof peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships' sternsabout the body of patroclus. like it or no, this is how it is decreed;for aught i care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath earth andsea, where iapetus and saturn dwell in lone tartarus with neither rayof light nor breath of wind to cheer them. you may go on and on tillyou get there, and i shall not care one whit for your displeasure; youare the greatest vixen living.\"juno made him no answer. the sun's glorious orb now sank into oceanusand drew down night over the land. sorry indeed were the trojans whenlight failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness fallupon the achaeans.then hector led the trojans back from the ships, and held a council onthe open space near the river, where there was a spot clear of corpses.they left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speechhe made them. he grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze pointof which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-headwas of gold. spear in hand he spoke. \"hear me,\" said he, \"trojans,dardanians, and allies. i deemed but now that i should destroy theships and all the achaeans with them ere i went back to ilius, butdarkness came on too soon. it was this alone that saved them and theirships upon the seashore. now, therefore, let us obey the behests ofnight, and prepare our suppers. take your horses out of their chariotsand give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep andcattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your horses andgather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires whoseflare may reach to heaven. for the achaeans may try to fly beyond thesea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested; manya man among them must take a dart with him to nurse at home, hit withspear or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others may fearto bring war and weeping upon the trojans. moreover let the heraldstell it about the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded men areto camp upon its heaven-built walls. let the women each of them light agreat fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town beentered by surprise while the host is outside. see to it, bravetrojans, as i have said, and let this suffice for the moment; atdaybreak i will instruct you further. i pray in hope to jove and to thegods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for'tis the fates that have borne them and their ships hither. this night,therefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put on ourarmour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the achaeans; i shall thenknow whether brave diomed the son of tydeus will drive me back from theships to the wall, or whether i shall myself slay him and carry off hisbloodstained spoils. to-morrow let him show his mettle, abide my spearif he dare. i ween that at break of day, he shall be among the first tofall and many another of his comrades round him. would that i were assure of being immortal and never growing old, and of being worshippedlike minerva and apollo, as i am that this day will bring evil to theargives.\"thus spoke hector and the trojans shouted applause. they took theirsweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his ownchariot. they made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city, theybrought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered much wood.they then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals, and the windcarried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven--but the blessed godspartook not thereof, for they bitterly hated ilius with priam andpriam's people. thus high in hope they sat through the livelong nightby the highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle. as whenthe stars shine clear, and the moon is bright--there is not a breath ofair, not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it stands out in theineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of heaven; the stars canall of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is glad--even thusshone the watchfires of the trojans before ilius midway between theships and the river xanthus. a thousand camp-fires gleamed upon theplain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty men, while the horses,champing oats and corn beside their chariots, waited till dawn shouldcome.book ix  the embassy to achilles.thus did the trojans watch. but panic, comrade of blood-stained rout,had taken fast hold of the achaeans, and their princes were all of themin despair. as when the two winds that blow from thrace--the north andthe northwest--spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury of the main--ina moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scatter their sea-wrackin all directions--even thus troubled were the hearts of the achaeans.the son of atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to acouncil man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste alsohimself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly.agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract on theside of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he spoke tothe achaeans. \"my friends,\" said he, \"princes and councillors of theargives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. cruel jovegave me his solemn promise that i should sack the city of troy beforereturning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me goingloriously back to argos with the loss of much people. such is thewill of jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust as he will yetlay others, for his power is above all. now, therefore, let us all doas i say and sail back to our own country, for we shall not take troy.\"thus he spoke, and the sons of the achaeans for a long while satsorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last diomed ofthe loud battle-cry made answer saying, \"son of atreus, i will chideyour folly, as is my right in council. be not then aggrieved that ishould do so. in the first place you attacked me before all the danaansand said that i was a coward and no soldier. the argives young and oldknow that you did so. but the son of scheming saturn endowed you byhalves only. he gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour,which is the highest both right and might he did not give you. sir,think you that the sons of the achaeans are indeed as unwarlike andcowardly as you say they are? if your own mind is set upon goinghome--go--the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you frommycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stay heretill we have sacked troy. nay though these too should turn homewardwith their ships, sthenelus and myself will still fight on till wereach the goal of ilius, for heaven was with us when we came.\"the sons of the achaeans shouted applause at the words of diomed, andpresently nestor rose to speak. \"son of tydeus,\" said he, \"in war yourprowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all who are ofyour own years; no one of the achaeans can make light of what you saynor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end of the wholematter. you are still young--you might be the youngest of my ownchildren--still you have spoken wisely and have counselled the chief ofthe achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless i am older than youand i will tell you everything; therefore let no man, not even kingagamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments civil discord is aclanless, hearthless outlaw.\"now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,but let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that iswithout the wall. i am giving these instructions to the young men; whenthey have been attended to, do you, son of atreus, give your orders,for you are the most royal among us all. prepare a feast for yourcouncillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so; there isabundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of the achaeans bringfrom thrace daily. you have everything at your disposal wherewith toentertain guests, and you have many subjects. when many are gottogether, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest--and sorelydo we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit hiswatchfires hard by our ships. who can be other than dismayed? thisnight will either be the ruin of our host, or save it.\"thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. the sentinels wentout in their armour under command of nestor's son thrasymedes, acaptain of the host, and of the bold warriors ascalaphus and ialmenus:there were also meriones, aphareus and deipyrus, and the son of creion,noble lycomedes. there were seven captains of the sentinels, and witheach there went a hundred youths armed with long spears: they tooktheir places midway between the trench and the wall, and when they haddone so they lit their fires and got every man his supper.the son of atreus then bade many councillors of the achaeans to hisquarters and prepared a great feast in their honour. they laid their handson the good things that were before them, and as soon as they hadenough to eat and drink, old nestor, whose counsel was ever truest, wasthe first to lay his mind before them. he, therefore, with allsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus.\"with yourself, most noble son of atreus, king of men, agamemnon, willi both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over much people.jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and to upholdrighteousness, that you may take thought for your people under you;therefore it behooves you above all others both to speak and to giveear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have been minded tospeak wisely. all turns on you and on your commands, therefore i willsay what i think will be best. no man will be of a truer mind than thatwhich has been mine from the hour when you, sir, angered achilles bytaking the girl briseis from his tent against my judgment. i urged younot to do so, but you yielded to your own pride, and dishonoured a herowhom heaven itself had honoured--for you still hold the prize that hadbeen awarded to him. now, however, let us think how we may appease him,both with presents and fair speeches that may conciliate him.\"and king agamemnon answered, \"sir, you have reproved my folly justly. iwas wrong. i own it. one whom heaven befriends is in himself a host,and jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying much peopleof the achaeans. i was blinded with passion and yielded to my worsermind; therefore i will make amends, and will give him great gifts byway of atonement. i will tell them in the presence of you all. i willgive him seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and tentalents of gold. i will give him twenty iron cauldrons and twelvestrong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. rich, indeed,both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my horses havewon me. i will give him seven excellent workwomen, lesbians, whom ichose for myself when he took lesbos--all of surpassing beauty. i willgive him these, and with them her whom i erewhile took from him, thedaughter of briseus; and i swear a great oath that i never went up intoher couch, nor have been with her after the manner of men and women.\"all these things will i give him now, and if hereafter the godsvouchsafe me to sack the city of priam, let him come when we achaeansare dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and bronze to hisliking; furthermore let him take twenty trojan women, the loveliestafter helen herself. then, when we reach achaean argos, wealthiest ofall lands, he shall be my son-in-law and i will show him like honourwith my own dear son orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance. ihave three daughters, chrysothemis, laodice, and iphianassa, let himtake the one of his choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to thehouse of peleus; i will add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gavehis daughter, and will give him seven well established cities,cardamyle, enope, and hire, where there is grass; holy pherae and therich meadows of anthea; aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes ofpedasus, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy pylos. the menthat dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour himwith gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to his comfortableordinances. all this will i do if he will now forgo his anger. let himthen yield; it is only hades who is utterly ruthless andunyielding--and hence he is of all gods the one most hateful tomankind. moreover i am older and more royal than himself. therefore,let him now obey me.\"then nestor answered, \"most noble son of atreus, king of men,agamemnon. the gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then sendchosen messengers, who may go to the tent of achilles son of peleuswithout delay. let those go whom i shall name. let phoenix, dear tojove, lead the way; let ajax and ulysses follow, and let the heraldsodius and eurybates go with them. now bring water for our hands, andbid all keep silence while we pray to jove the son of saturn, if so bethat he may have mercy upon us.\"thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. men-servantspoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled themixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after givingevery man his drink-offering; then, when they had made their offerings,and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set out fromthe tent of agamemnon son of atreus; and nestor, looking first to oneand then to another, but most especially at ulysses, was instant withthem that they should prevail with the noble son of peleus.they went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayedearnestly to earth-encircling neptune that the high spirit of the sonof aeacus might incline favourably towards them. when they reached theships and tents of the myrmidons, they found achilles playing on alyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver. itwas part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city ofeetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing the featsof heroes. he was alone with patroclus, who sat opposite to him andsaid nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. ulysses and ajaxnow came in--ulysses leading the way--and stood before him. achillessprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and patroclus,when he saw the strangers, rose also. achilles then greeted themsaying, \"all hail and welcome--you must come upon some great matter,you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the achaeans.\"with this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered withpurple rugs; then he said to patroclus who was close by him, \"son ofmenoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water with thewine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear friends, whoare now under my roof.\"patroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block infront of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the loin alsoof a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. automedon held the meat whileachilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put them on spitswhile the son of menoetius made the fire burn high. when the flame haddied down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top of them, liftingthem up and setting them upon the spit-racks; and he sprinkled themwith salt. when the meat was roasted, he set it on platters, and handedbread round the table in fair baskets, while achilles dealt them theirportions. then achilles took his seat facing ulysses against theopposite wall, and bade his comrade patroclus offer sacrifice to thegods; so he cast the offerings into the fire, and they laid their handsupon the good things that were before them. as soon as they had hadenough to eat and drink, ajax made a sign to phoenix, and when he sawthis, ulysses filled his cup with wine and pledged achilles.\"hail,\" said he, \"achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer, neitherin the tent of agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been plenty to eatand drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter. sir, we are inthe face of great disaster, and without your help know not whether weshall save our fleet or lose it. the trojans and their allies havecamped hard by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfiresthroughout their host and deem that nothing can now prevent them fromfalling on our fleet. jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on theirright; hector, in all his glory, rages like a maniac; confident thatjove is with him he fears neither god nor man, but is gone raving mad,and prays for the approach of day. he vows that he will hew the highsterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls, and make havocof the achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in smoke; i muchfear that heaven will make good his boasting, and it will prove our lotto perish at troy far from our home in argos. up, then, and late thoughit be, save the sons of the achaeans who faint before the fury of thetrojans. you will repent bitterly hereafter if you do not, for when theharm is done there will be no curing it; consider ere it be too late,and save the danaans from destruction.\"my good friend, when your father peleus sent you from phthia toagamemnon, did he not charge you saying, 'son, minerva and juno willmake you strong if they choose, but check your high temper, for thebetter part is in goodwill. eschew vain quarrelling, and the achaeansold and young will respect you more for doing so.' these were hiswords, but you have forgotten them. even now, however, be appeased, andput away your anger from you. agamemnon will make you great amends ifyou will forgive him; listen, and i will tell you what he has said inhis tent that he will give you. he will give you seven tripods thathave never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold; twenty ironcauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have won races and carried offprizes. rich indeed both in land and gold is he who has as many prizesas these horses have won for agamemnon. moreover he will give you sevenexcellent workwomen, lesbians, whom he chose for himself, when you tooklesbos--all of surpassing beauty. he will give you these, and with themher whom he erewhile took from you, the daughter of briseus, and hewill swear a great oath, he has never gone up into her couch nor beenwith her after the manner of men and women. all these things will hegive you now down, and if hereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack thecity of priam, you can come when we achaeans are dividing the spoil,and load your ship with gold and bronze to your liking. you can taketwenty trojan women, the loveliest after helen herself. then, when wereach achaean argos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be hisson-in-law, and he will show you like honour with his own dear sonorestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance. agamemnon has threedaughters, chrysothemis, laodice, and iphianassa; you may take the oneof your choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house ofpeleus; he will add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave hisdaughter, and will give you seven well-established cities, cardamyle,enope, and hire where there is grass; holy pheras and the rich meadowsof anthea; aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of pedasus, all nearthe sea, and on the borders of sandy pylos. the men that dwell thereare rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as thoughwere a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. all thiswill he do if you will now forgo your anger. moreover, though you hateboth him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the rest of theachaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will honour youas a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. you might evenkill hector; he will come within your reach, for he is infatuated, anddeclares that not a danaan whom the ships have brought can hold his ownagainst him.\"achilles answered, \"ulysses, noble son of laertes, i should give youformal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be nomore of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. him do ihate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hidesanother in his heart; therefore i will say what i mean. i will beappeased neither by agamemnon son of atreus nor by any other of thedanaans, for i see that i have no thanks for all my fighting. he thatfights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are heldin equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who works and himwho is idle. i have taken nothing by all my hardships--with my lifeever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes it to hernestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so many a long night have ibeen wakeful, and many a bloody battle have i waged by day againstthose who were fighting for their women. with my ships i have takentwelve cities, and eleven round about troy have i stormed with my menby land; i took great store of wealth from every one of them, but igave all up to agamemnon son of atreus. he stayed where he was by hisships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept much himself.\"nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among thechieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone of theachaeans did he take the woman in whom i delighted--let him keep herand sleep with her. why, pray, must the argives needs fight thetrojans? what made the son of atreus gather the host and bring them?was it not for the sake of helen? are the sons of atreus the only menin the world who love their wives? any man of common right feeling willlove and cherish her who is his own, as i this woman, with my wholeheart, though she was but a fruitling of my spear. agamemnon has takenher from me; he has played me false; i know him; let him tempt me nofurther, for he shall not move me. let him look to you, ulysses, and tothe other princes to save his ships from burning. he has done muchwithout me already. he has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep andwide all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but evenso he stays not the murderous might of hector. so long as i fought theachaeans hector suffered not the battle range far from the city walls;he would come to the scaean gates and to the oak tree, but no further.once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape my onset: now,however, since i am in no mood to fight him, i will to-morrow offersacrifice to jove and to all the gods; i will draw my ships into thewater and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning, if you care tolook, you will see my ships on the hellespont, and my men rowing out tosea with might and main. if great neptune vouchsafes me a fair passage,in three days i shall be in phthia. i have much there that i leftbehind me when i came here to my sorrow, and i shall bring back stillfurther store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and of iron, myshare of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize, he who gave hasinsolently taken away. tell him all as i now bid you, and tell him inpublic that the achaeans may hate him and beware of him should he thinkthat he can yet dupe others for his effrontery never fails him.\"as for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. i willtake no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in common withhim. he has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen mefurther; let him go his own way, for jove has robbed him of his reason.i loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw. he may offerme ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay--not though it beall that he has in the world, both now or ever shall have; he maypromise me the wealth of orchomenus or of egyptian thebes, which is therichest city in the whole world, for it has a hundred gates througheach of which two hundred men may drive at once with their chariots andhorses; he may offer me gifts as the sands of the sea or the dust ofthe plain in multitude, but even so he shall not move me till i havebeen revenged in full for the bitter wrong he has done me. i will notmarry his daughter; she may be fair as venus, and skilful as minerva,but i will have none of her: let another take her, who may be a goodmatch for her and who rules a larger kingdom. if the gods spare me toreturn home, peleus will find me a wife; there are achaean women inhellas and phthia, daughters of kings that have cities under them; ofthese i can take whom i will and marry her. many a time was i mindedwhen at home in phthia to woo and wed a woman who would make me asuitable wife, and to enjoy the riches of my old father peleus. my lifeis more to me than all the wealth of ilius while it was yet at peacebefore the achaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies onthe stone floor of apollo's temple beneath the cliffs of pytho. cattleand sheep are to be had for harrying, and a man buy both tripods andhorses if he wants them, but when his life has once left him it canneither be bought nor harried back again.\"my mother thetis tells me that there are two ways in which i may meetmy end. if i stay here and fight, i shall not return alive but my namewill live for ever: whereas if i go home my name will die, but it willbe long ere death shall take me. to the rest of you, then, i say, 'gohome, for you will not take ilius.' jove has held his hand over her toprotect her, and her people have taken heart. go, therefore, as in dutybound, and tell the princes of the achaeans the message that i havesent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving of theirships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the one that theyhave now hit upon may not be. as for phoenix, let him sleep here thathe may sail with me in the morning if he so will. but i will not takehim by force.\"they all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he haddenied them, till presently the old knight phoenix in his great fearfor the ships of the achaeans, burst into tears and said, \"nobleachilles, if you are now minded to return, and in the fierceness ofyour anger will do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my son,can i remain here without you? your father peleus bade me go with youwhen he sent you as a mere lad from phthia to agamemnon. you knewnothing neither of war nor of the arts whereby men make their mark incouncil, and he sent me with you to train you in all excellence ofspeech and action. therefore, my son, i will not stay here withoutyou--no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from offme, and make me young as i was when i first left hellas the land offair women. i was then flying the anger of father amyntor, son oformenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine, ofwhom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother. my mother,therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the woman myself, thatso she hate my father, and in the course of time i yielded. but myfather soon came to know, and cursed me bitterly, calling the dreaderinyes to witness. he prayed that no son of mine might ever sit uponknees--and the gods, jove of the world below and awful proserpine,fulfilled his curse. i took counsel to kill him, but some god stayed myrashness and bade me think on men's evil tongues and how i should bebranded as the murderer of my father; nevertheless i could not bear tostay in my father's house with him so bitter against me. my cousinsand clansmen came about me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many asheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog did theyset down to roast before the fire; many a jar, too, did they broach ofmy father's wine. nine whole nights did they set a guard over me takingit in turns to watch, and they kept a fire always burning, both in thecloister of the outer court and in the inner court at the doors of theroom wherein i lay; but when the darkness of the tenth night came, ibroke through the closed doors of my room, and climbed the wall of theouter court after passing quickly and unperceived through the men onguard and the women servants. i then fled through hellas till i came tofertile phthia, mother of sheep, and to king peleus, who made mewelcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heirto all his wealth. he made me rich and set me over much people,establishing me on the borders of phthia where i was chief ruler overthe dolopians.\"it was i, achilles, who had the making of you; i loved you with all myheart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone outelsewhere, till i had first set you upon my knees, cut up the daintymorsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your lips. many atime have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness over my shirt; ihad infinite trouble with you, but i knew that heaven had vouchsafed meno offspring of my own, and i made a son of you, achilles, that in myhour of need you might protect me. now, therefore, i say battle withyour pride and beat it; cherish not your anger for ever; the might andmajesty of heaven are more than ours, but even heaven may be appeased;and if a man has sinned he prays the gods, and reconciles them tohimself by his piteous cries and by frankincense, with drink-offeringsand the savour of burnt sacrifice. for prayers are as daughters togreat jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes askance, they follow in thefootsteps of sin, who, being fierce and fleet of foot, leaves them farbehind him, and ever baneful to mankind outstrips them even to the endsof the world; but nevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healingafter. if a man has pity upon these daughters of jove when they drawnear him, they will bless him and hear him too when he is praying; butif he deny them and will not listen to them, they go to jove the son ofsaturn and pray that he may presently fall into sin--to his ruingbitterly hereafter. therefore, achilles, give these daughters of jovedue reverence, and bow before them as all good men will bow. were notthe son of atreus offering you gifts and promising others later--if hewere still furious and implacable--i am not he that would bid you throwoff your anger and help the achaeans, no matter how great their need;but he is giving much now, and more hereafter; he has sent his captainsto urge his suit, and has chosen those who of all the argives are mostacceptable to you; make not then their words and their coming to be ofnone effect. your anger has been righteous so far. we have heard insong how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were roused to fury,but still they could be won by gifts, and fair words could soothe them.\"i have an old story in my mind--a very old one--but you are allfriends and i will tell it. the curetes and the aetolians were fightingand killing one another round calydon--the aetolians defending the cityand the curetes trying to destroy it. for diana of the golden thronewas angry and did them hurt because oeneus had not offered her hisharvest first-fruits. the other gods had all been feasted withhecatombs, but to the daughter of great jove alone he had made nosacrifice. he had forgotten her, or somehow or other it had escapedhim, and this was a grievous sin. thereon the archer goddess in herdispleasure sent a prodigious creature against him--a savage wild boarwith great white tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands,uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them to the ground.but meleager son of oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities andkilled it--for it was so monstrous that not a few were needed, and manya man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. on this the goddess set thecuretes and the aetolians fighting furiously about the head and skin ofthe boar.\"so long as meleager was in the field things went badly with thecuretes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their groundunder the city walls; but in the course of time meleager was angered aseven a wise man will sometimes be. he was incensed with his motheralthaea, and therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife faircleopatra, who was daughter of marpessa daughter of euenus, and of idesthe man then living. he it was who took his bow and faced king apollohimself for fair marpessa's sake; her father and mother then named heralcyone, because her mother had mourned with the plaintive strains ofthe halcyon-bird when phoebus apollo had carried her off. meleager,then, stayed at home with cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt byreason of his mother's curses. his mother, grieving for the death ofher brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands,calling upon hades and on awful proserpine; she went down upon herknees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed that they wouldkill her son--and erinys that walks in darkness and knows no ruth heardher from erebus.\"then was heard the din of battle about the gates of calydon, and thedull thump of the battering against their walls. thereon the elders ofthe aetolians besought meleager; they sent the chiefest of theirpriests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising him agreat reward. they bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most fertilein the plain of calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other openplough-land. the old warrior oeneus implored him, standing at thethreshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. hissisters and his mother herself besought him sore, but he the morerefused them; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to himalso prayed him, but they could not move him till the foe was batteringat the very doors of his chamber, and the curetes had scaled the wallsand were setting fire to the city. then at last his sorrowing wifedetailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken; shereminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given over to theflames, while the women and children are carried into captivity; whenhe heard all this, his heart was touched, and he donned his armour togo forth. thus of his own inward motion he saved the city of theaetolians; but they now gave him nothing of those rich rewards thatthey had offered earlier, and though he saved the city he took nothingby it. be not then, my son, thus minded; let not heaven lure you intoany such course. when the ships are burning it will be a harder matterto save them. take the gifts, and go, for the achaeans will then honouryou as a god; whereas if you fight without taking them, you may beatthe battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.\"and achilles answered, \"phoenix, old friend and father, i have no needof such honour. i have honour from jove himself, which will abide withme at my ships while i have breath in my body, and my limbs are strong.i say further--and lay my saying to your heart--vex me no more withthis weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son of atreus.love him so well, and you may lose the love i bear you. you ought tohelp me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be king as much as iam, and share like honour with myself; the others shall take my answer;stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; at daybreak wewill consider whether to remain or go.\"on this he nodded quietly to patroclus as a sign that he was to preparea bed for phoenix, and that the others should take their leave. ajaxson of telamon then said, \"ulysses, noble son of laertes, let us begone, for i see that our journey is vain. we must now take our answer,unwelcome though it be, to the danaans who are waiting to receive it.achilles is savage and remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing forthe love his comrades lavished upon him more than on all the others. heis implacable--and yet if a man's brother or son has been slain he willaccept a fine by way of amends from him that killed him, and thewrong-doer having paid in full remains in peace among his own people;but as for you, achilles, the gods have put a wicked unforgiving spiritin your heart, and this, all about one single girl, whereas we nowoffer you the seven best we have, and much else into the bargain. bethen of a more gracious mind, respect the hospitality of your own roof.we are with you as messengers from the host of the danaans, and wouldfain he held nearest and dearest to yourself of all the achaeans.\"\"ajax,\" replied achilles, \"noble son of telamon, you have spoken muchto my liking, but my blood boils when i think it all over, and rememberhow the son of atreus treated me with contumely as though i were somevile tramp, and that too in the presence of the argives. go, then, anddeliver your message; say that i will have no concern with fightingtill hector, son of noble priam, reaches the tents of the myrmidons inhis murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships. for all hislust of battle, i take it he will be held in check when he is at my owntent and ship.\"on this they took every man his double cup, made their drink-offerings,and went back to the ships, ulysses leading the way. but patroclus toldhis men and the maid-servants to make ready a comfortable bed forphoenix; they therefore did so with sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet offine linen. the old man then laid himself down and waited till morningcame. but achilles slept in an inner room, and beside him the daughterof phorbas lovely diomede, whom he had carried off from lesbos.patroclus lay on the other side of the room, and with him fair iphiswhom achilles had given him when he took scyros the city of enyeus.when the envoys reached the tents of the son of atreus, the achaeansrose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. kingagamemnon was the first to do so. \"tell me, ulysses,\" said he, \"will hesave the ships from burning, or did he refuse, and is he still furious?\"ulysses answered, \"most noble son of atreus, king of men, agamemnon,achilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever, andspurns both you and your gifts. he bids you take counsel with theachaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself, hesaid that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water. he saidfurther that he should advise every one to sail home likewise, for thatyou will not reach the goal of ilius. 'jove,' he said, 'has laid hishand over the city to protect it, and the people have taken heart.'this is what he said, and the others who were with me can tell you thesame story--ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, who may betrusted. the old man phoenix stayed where he was to sleep, for soachilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the morningif he so would; but he will not take him by force.\"they all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and dejected,by reason of the sternness with which achilles had refused them, tillpresently diomed said, \"most noble son of atreus, king of men,agamemnon, you ought not to have sued the son of peleus nor offered himgifts. he is proud enough as it is, and you have encouraged him in hispride still further. let him stay or go as he will. he will fight laterwhen he is in the humour, and heaven puts it in his mind to do so. now,therefore, let us all do as i say; we have eaten and drunk our fill,let us then take our rest, for in rest there is both strength and stay.but when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out your hostand your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them on, and yourselffighting among the foremost.\"thus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. they thenmade their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent, wherethey laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.book x  ulysses and diomed go out as spies, and meet dolon, who gives  them information: they then kill him, and profiting by what  he had told them, kill rhesus king of the thracians and take  his horses.now the other princes of the achaeans slept soundly the whole nightthrough, but agamemnon son of atreus was troubled, so that he could getno rest. as when fair juno's lord flashes his lightning in token ofgreat rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground, oragain as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war, even sodid agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled withinhim. when he looked upon the plain of troy he marvelled at the manywatchfires burning in front of ilius, and at the sound of pipes andflutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards theships and hosts of the achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls beforejove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of his soul.in the end he deemed it best to go at once to nestor son of neleus, andsee if between them they could find any way of the achaeans fromdestruction. he therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound his sandalsabout his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny lion over hisshoulders--a skin that reached his feet--and took his spear in his hand.neither could menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the argiveswho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight thetrojans. he covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther,put a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawnyhand. then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the mostpowerful of the achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though hewere a god. he found him by the stern of his ship already putting hisgoodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that hisbrother had come.menelaus spoke first. \"why,\" said he, \"my dear brother, are you thusarming? are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit thetrojans? i greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spyupon the enemy alone in the dead of night. it will be a deed of greatdaring.\"and king agamemnon answered, \"menelaus, we both of us need shrewdcounsel to save the argives and our ships, for jove has changed hismind, and inclines towards hector's sacrifices rather than ours. inever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in oneday as hector has now wrought against the sons of the achaeans--andthat too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god norgoddess. the argives will rue it long and deeply. run, therefore, withall speed by the line of the ships, and call ajax and idomeneus.meanwhile i will go to nestor, and bid him rise and go about among thecompanies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they willlisten to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and merionesbrother in arms to idomeneus, are captains over them. it was to themmore particularly that we gave this charge.\"menelaus replied, \"how do i take your meaning? am i to stay with themand wait your coming, or shall i return here as soon as i have givenyour orders?\" \"wait,\" answered king agamemnon, \"for there are so manypaths about the camp that we might miss one another. call every man onyour way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and by hisfather's name, give each all titular observance, and stand not too muchupon your own dignity; we must take our full share of toil, for at ourbirth jove laid this heavy burden upon us.\"with these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on tonestor shepherd of his people. he found him sleeping in his tent hardby his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him--his shield, his twospears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle withwhich the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people intobattle--for his age stayed him not. he raised himself on his elbow andlooked up at agamemnon. \"who is it,\" said he, \"that goes thus about thehost and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when men aresleeping? are you looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? donot stand there and say nothing, but speak. what is your business?\"and agamemnon answered, \"nestor, son of neleus, honour to the achaeanname, it is i, agamemnon son of atreus, on whom jove has laid labourand sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry me.i am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my heartis big with war and with the jeopardy of the achaeans. i am in greatfear for the danaans. i am at sea, and without sure counsel; my heartbeats as though it would leap out of my body, and my limbs fail me. ifthen you can do anything--for you too cannot sleep--let us go the roundof the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping tothe neglect of their duty. the enemy is encamped hard and we know notbut he may attack us by night.\"nestor replied, \"most noble son of atreus, king of men, agamemnon, jovewill not do all for hector that hector thinks he will; he will havetroubles yet in plenty if achilles will lay aside his anger. i will gowith you, and we will rouse others, either the son of tydeus, orulysses, or fleet ajax and the valiant son of phyleus. some one hadalso better go and call ajax and king idomeneus, for their ships arenot near at hand but the farthest of all. i cannot however refrain fromblaming menelaus, much as i love him and respect him--and i will say soplainly, even at the risk of offending you--for sleeping and leavingall this trouble to yourself. he ought to be going about imploring aidfrom all the princes of the achaeans, for we are in extreme danger.\"and agamemnon answered, \"sir, you may sometimes blame him justly, forhe is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself--not indeed fromsloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects meto take the lead. on this occasion, however, he was awake before i was,and came to me of his own accord. i have already sent him to call thevery men whom you have named. and now let us be going. we shall findthem with the watch outside the gates, for it was there i said that wewould meet them.\"\"in that case,\" answered nestor, \"the argives will not blame him nordisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives theminstructions.\"with this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his comelyfeet. he buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, and ofa rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, andwended his way along the line of the achaean ships. first he calledloudly to ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was soonroused by the sound of the battle-cry. he came outside his tent andsaid, \"why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the line ofthe ships in the stillness of the night? what is it that you find sourgent?\" and nestor knight of gerene answered, \"ulysses, noble son oflaertes, take it not amiss, for the achaeans are in great straits. comewith me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us whetherwe shall fight or fly.\"on this ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about hisshoulders and came out with them. first they went to diomed son oftydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with hiscomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as fortheir spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts that weredriven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar like thelightning of father jove. the hero was sleeping upon the skin of an ox,with a piece of fine carpet under his head; nestor went up to him andstirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging himto bestir himself. \"wake up,\" he exclaimed, \"son of tydeus. how can yousleep on in this way? can you not see that the trojans are encamped onthe brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a little spacebetween us and them?\"on these words diomed leaped up instantly and said, \"old man, yourheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. are thereno younger men among the achaeans who could go about to rouse theprinces? there is no tiring you.\"and nestor knight of gerene made answer, \"my son, all that you havesaid is true. i have good sons, and also much people who might call thechieftains, but the achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and deathare balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. go then, for you areyounger than i, and of your courtesy rouse ajax and the fleet son ofphyleus.\"diomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders--a skinthat reached his feet--and grasped his spear. when he had roused theheroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round ofthose who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at theirposts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. as sheep dogsthat watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beastcoming through the mountain forest towards them--forthwith there is ahue and cry of dogs and men, and slumber is broken--even so was sleepchased from the eyes of the achaeans as they kept the watches of thewicked night, for they turned constantly towards the plain wheneverthey heard any stir among the trojans. the old man was glad and badethem be of good cheer. \"watch on, my children,\" said he, \"and let notsleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.\"with this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of theachaeans who had been called to the council. meriones and the brave sonof nestor went also, for the princes bade them. when they were beyondthe trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting on theopen ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it was herethat when night fell hector had turned back from his onslaught on theargives. they sat down, therefore, and held debate with one another.nestor spoke first. \"my friends,\" said he, \"is there any man boldenough to venture among the trojans, and cut off some straggler, orbring us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay hereby the ships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worstedthe achaeans, they will retire within their walls. if he could learnall this and come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven inthe mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefsfrom all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with herlamb--which is a present of surpassing value--and he would be asked asa guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings.\"they all held their peace, but diomed of the loud war-cry spoke saying,\"nestor, gladly will i visit the host of the trojans over against us,but if another will go with me i shall do so in greater confidence andcomfort. when two men are together, one of them may see someopportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alonehe is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker.\"on this several offered to go with diomed. the two ajaxes, servants ofmars, meriones, and the son of nestor all wanted to go, so did menelausson of atreus; ulysses also wished to go among the host of the trojans,for he was ever full of daring, and thereon agamemnon king of men spokethus: \"diomed,\" said he, \"son of tydeus, man after my own heart, chooseyour comrade for yourself--take the best man of those that haveoffered, for many would now go with you. do not through delicacy rejectthe better man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage,because he is of more royal blood.\"he said this because he feared for menelaus. diomed answered, \"if youbid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can i fail tothink of ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face allkinds of danger--and pallas minerva loves him well? if he were to gowith me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is quick tosee and understand.\"\"son of tydeus,\" replied ulysses, \"say neither good nor ill about me,for you are among argives who know me well. let us be going, for thenight wanes and dawn is at hand. the stars have gone forward,two-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone leftus.\"they then put on their armour. brave thrasymedes provided the son oftydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship)and on his head he set a helmet of bull's hide without either peak orcrest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear. merionesfound a bow and quiver for ulysses, and on his head he set a leathernhelmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern thongs, whileon the outside it was thickly studded with boar's teeth, well andskilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner lining of felt.this helmet had been stolen by autolycus out of eleon when he brokeinto the house of amyntor son of ormenus. he gave it to amphidamas ofcythera to take to scandea, and amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift tomolus, who gave it to his son meriones; and now it was set upon thehead of ulysses.when the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftainsbehind them. pallas minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon theirright hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they heard itscry. ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to minerva: \"hearme,\" he cried, \"daughter of aegis-bearing jove, you who spy out all myways and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend me in this minehour, and grant that we may return to the ships covered with gloryafter having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow tothe trojans.\"then diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: \"hear me too,\" said he,\"daughter of jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with mynoble father tydeus when he went to thebes as envoy sent by theachaeans. he left the achaeans by the banks of the river aesopus, andwent to the city bearing a message of peace to the cadmeians; on hisreturn thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring,for you were his ready helper. even so guide me and guard me now, andin return i will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a yearold, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. i will gildher horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\"thus they prayed, and pallas minerva heard their prayer. when they haddone praying to the daughter of great jove, they went their way liketwo lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained bodies ofthem that had fallen.neither again did hector let the trojans sleep; for he too called theprinces and councillors of the trojans that he might set his counselbefore them. \"is there one,\" said he, \"who for a great reward will dome the service of which i will tell you? he shall be well paid if hewill. i will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the fleetestthat can be found at the ships of the achaeans, if he will dare thisthing; and he will win infinite honour to boot; he must go to the shipsand find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore, or whethernow that we have beaten them the achaeans design to fly, and throughsheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.\"they all held their peace; but there was among the trojans a certainman named dolon, son of eumedes, the famous herald--a man rich in goldand bronze. he was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an only sonamong five sisters. he it was that now addressed the trojans. \"i,hector,\" said he, \"will to the ships and will exploit them. but firsthold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot,bedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the noble son ofpeleus. i will make you a good scout, and will not fail you. i will gothrough the host from one end to the other till i come to the ship ofagamemnon, where i take it the princes of the achaeans are nowconsulting whether they shall fight or fly.\"when he had done speaking hector held up his sceptre, and swore him hisoath saying, \"may jove the thundering husband of juno bear witness thatno other trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that youshall have your will with them for ever.\"the oath he swore was bootless, but it made dolon more keen on going.he hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the skinof a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. then hetook a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he was notto return with any news for hector. when he had left the horses and thetroops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but ulysses perceivedhis coming and said to diomed, \"diomed, here is some one from the camp;i am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief whowould plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, wecan then spring upon him and take him. if, however, he is too quick forus, go after him with your spear and hem him in towards the ships awayfrom the trojan camp, to prevent his getting back to the town.\"with this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses.dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got aboutas far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds one thathas been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land quicker thanoxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps he stoodstill, for he made sure they were friends from the trojan camp come byhector's orders to bid him return; when, however, they were only aspear's cast, or less, away from him, he saw that they were enemies and ranas fast as his legs could take him. the others gave chase at once, and asa couple of well-trained hounds press forward after a doe or hare thatruns screaming in front of them, even so did the son of tydeus andulysses pursue dolon and cut him off from his own people. but when hehad fled so far towards the ships that he would soon have fallen inwith the outposts, minerva infused fresh strength into the son oftydeus for fear some other of the achaeans might have the glory ofbeing first to hit him, and he might himself be only second; hetherefore sprang forward with his spear and said, \"stand, or i shallthrow my spear, and in that case i shall soon make an end of you.\"he threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. the dart flew overthe man's right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. he stood stockstill, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and he turnedpale with fear. the two came breathless up to him and seized his hands,whereon he began to weep and said, \"take me alive; i will ransommyself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and fromthis my father will satisfy you with a very large ransom, should hehear of my being alive at the ships of the achaeans.\"\"fear not,\" replied ulysses, \"let no thought of death be in your mind;but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about alone inthe dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, whileother men are sleeping? is it to plunder the bodies of the slain, ordid hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships? or didyou come here of your own mere notion?\"dolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: \"hector, with his vainflattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. he said hewould give me the horses of the noble son of peleus and hisbronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of theflying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the shipsare still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beatenthem, the achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion areneglecting to keep their watches.\"ulysses smiled at him and answered, \"you had indeed set your heart upona great reward, but the horses of the descendant of aeacus are hardlyto be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than achilleshimself, whose mother was an immortal. but tell me, and tell me true,where did you leave hector when you started? where lies his armour andhis horses? how, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of thetrojans ordered? what are their plans? will they stay here by the shipsand away from the city, or now that they have worsted the achaeans,will they retire within their walls?\"and dolon answered, \"i will tell you truly all. hector and the othercouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of great ilus,away from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask me,there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host. the trojans havetheir watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore, areawake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the allieswho have come from other places are asleep and leave it to the trojansto keep guard, for their wives and children are not here.\"ulysses then said, \"now tell me; are they sleeping among the trojantroops, or do they lie apart? explain this that i may understand it.\"\"i will tell you truly all,\" replied dolon. \"to the seaward lie thecarians, the paeonian bowmen, the leleges, the cauconians, and thenoble pelasgi. the lysians and proud mysians, with the phrygians andmeonians, have their place on the side towards thymbra; but why askabout all this? if you want to find your way into the host of thetrojans, there are the thracians, who have lately come here and lieapart from the others at the far end of the camp; and they have rhesusson of eioneus for their king. his horses are the finest and strongestthat i have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than anywind that blows. his chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and hehas brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarestworkmanship--too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet onlyfor the gods. now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securelyhere, until you come back and have proved my words whether they befalse or true.\"diomed looked sternly at him and answered, \"think not, dolon, for allthe good information you have given us, that you shall escape now youare in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will comesome second time to the ships of the achaeans either as a spy or as anopen enemy, but if i kill you and an end of you, you will give no moretrouble.\"on this dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech himfurther, but diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his swordand cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dustwhile he was yet speaking. they took the ferret-skin cap from his head,and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. ulysses hung themup aloft in honour of minerva the goddess of plunder, and prayedsaying, \"accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in preferenceto all the gods in olympus: therefore speed us still further towardsthe horses and sleeping-ground of the thracians.\"with these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree,and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs oftamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through theflying hours of darkness. the two then went onwards amid the fallenarmour and the blood, and came presently to the company of thraciansoldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day's toil; theirgoodly armour was lying on the ground beside them all orderly in threerows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. rhesus wassleeping in the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast tothe topmost rim of his chariot. ulysses from some way off saw him andsaid, \"this, diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about whichdolon whom we killed told us. do your very utmost; dally not about yourarmour, but loose the horses at once--or else kill the men yourself,while i see to the horses.\"thereon minerva put courage into the heart of diomed, and he smote themright and left. they made a hideous groaning as they were being hackedabout, and the earth was red with their blood. as a lion springsfuriously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds them withouttheir shepherd, so did the son of tydeus set upon the thracian soldierstill he had killed twelve. as he killed them ulysses came and drew themaside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go forward freelywithout being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for theywere not yet used to them. when the son of tydeus came to the king, hekilled him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing hard, for bythe counsel of minerva an evil dream, the seed of oeneus, hovered thatnight over his head. meanwhile ulysses untied the horses, made themfast one to another and drove them off, striking them with his bow, forhe had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. then he whistled asa sign to diomed.but diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed hemight accomplish. he was doubting whether to take the chariot in whichthe king's armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to liftthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not killsome more thracians. while he was thus hesitating minerva came up tohim and said, \"get back, diomed, to the ships or you may be driventhither, should some other god rouse the trojans.\"diomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon thehorses. ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to theships of the achaeans.but apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw minerva with the son oftydeus. he was angry with her, and coming to the host of the trojans heroused hippocoon, a counsellor of the thracians and a noble kinsman ofrhesus. he started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses were nolonger in their place, and that the men were gasping in theirdeath-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend byname. then the whole trojan camp was in an uproar as the people kepthurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes whohad now got away towards the ships.when they reached the place where they had killed hector's scout,ulysses stayed his horses, and the son of tydeus, leaping to theground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of ulysses andremounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forwardnothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will. nestorwas first to hear the tramp of their feet. \"my friends,\" said he,\"princes and counsellors of the argives, shall i guess right orwrong?--but i must say what i think: there is a sound in my ears as ofthe tramp of horses. i hope it may be diomed and ulysses driving inhorses from the trojans, but i much fear that the bravest of theargives may have come to some harm at their hands.\"he had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulatedthem. nestor knight of gerene was first to question them. \"tell me,\"said he, \"renowned ulysses, how did you two come by these horses? didyou steal in among the trojan forces, or did some god meet you and givethem to you? they are like sunbeams. i am well conversant with thetrojans, for old warrior though i am i never hold back by the ships,but i never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are. surely somegod must have met you and given them to you, for you are both of youdear to jove, and to jove's daughter minerva.\"and ulysses answered, \"nestor son of neleus, honour to the achaeanname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these,for the gods are far mightier than we are. these horses, however, aboutwhich you ask me, are freshly come from thrace. diomed killed theirking with the twelve bravest of his companions. hard by the ships wetook a thirteenth man--a scout whom hector and the other trojans hadsent as a spy upon our ships.\"he laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while theother achaeans followed him gladly. when they reached the stronglybuilt quarters of the son of tydeus, they tied the horses with thongsof leather to the manger, where the steeds of diomed stood eating theirsweet corn, but ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of dolon at thestern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering tominerva. as for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the sweatfrom their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. when the sea-waterhad taken all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, theywent into the baths and washed themselves. after they had so done andhad anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table, and drawingfrom a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine to minerva.book xi  in the forenoon the fight is equal, but agamemnon turns the  fortune of the day towards the achaeans until he gets  wounded and leaves the field--hector then drives everything  before him till he is wounded by diomed--paris wounds  diomed--ulysses, nestor, and idomeneus perform prodigies  of valour--machaon is wounded--nestor drives him off in  his chariot--achilles sees the pair driving towards the camp  and sends patroclus to ask who it is that is wounded--this  is the beginning of evil for patroclus--nestor makes a long  speech.and now as dawn rose from her couch beside tithonus, harbinger of lightalike to mortals and immortals, jove sent fierce discord with theensign of war in her hands to the ships of the achaeans. she took herstand by the huge black hull of ulysses' ship which was middlemost ofall, so that her voice might carry farthest on either side, on the onehand towards the tents of ajax son of telamon, and on the other towardsthose of achilles--for these two heroes, well-assured of their ownstrength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of theline. there she took her stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrillthat filled the achaeans with courage, giving them heart to fightresolutely and with all their might, so that they had rather stay thereand do battle than go home in their ships.the son of atreus shouted aloud and bade the argives gird themselvesfor battle while he put on his armour. first he girded his goodlygreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle-clasps of silver;and about his chest he set the breastplate which cinyras had once givenhim as a guest-gift. it had been noised abroad as far as cyprus thatthe achaeans were about to sail for troy, and therefore he gave it tothe king. it had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold, and ten oftin. there were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves up towardsthe neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which the son ofsaturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. about his shouldershe threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and the scabbard wasof silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang it. he took moreoverthe richly-dight shield that covered his body when he was inbattle--fair to see, with ten circles of bronze running all round it.on the body of the shield there were twenty bosses of white tin, withanother of dark cyanus in the middle: this last was made to show agorgon's head, fierce and grim, with rout and panic on either side. theband for the arm to go through was of silver, on which there was awrithing snake of cyanus with three heads that sprang from a singleneck, and went in and out among one another. on his head agamemnon seta helmet, with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse-hairthat nodded menacingly above it; then he grasped two redoubtablebronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his armour shot from him as aflame into the firmament, while juno and minerva thundered in honour ofthe king of rich mycene.every man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold themin readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot clad infull armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning. thechiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got there, butthese came up presently. the son of saturn sent a portent of evil soundabout their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for he was about tosend many a brave man hurrying down to hades.the trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain, weregathered round great hector, noble polydamas, aeneas who was honouredby the trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of antenor,polybus, agenor, and young acamas beauteous as a god. hector's roundshield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful star that shinesfor a moment through a rent in the clouds and is again hidden beneaththem; even so was hector now seen in the front ranks and now again inthe hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed like the lightning ofaegis-bearing jove.and now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a richman's land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did thetrojans and achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood foryielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better of theother. discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the only godthat went among them; the others were not there, but stayed quietlyeach in his own home among the dells and valleys of olympus. all ofthem blamed the son of saturn for wanting to give victory to thetrojans, but father jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all, andsat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city ofthe trojans, the ships of the achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and alikeupon the slayers and on the slain.now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their dartsrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hourdrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get hismidday meal--for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is tiredout, and must now have food--then the danaans with a cry that rangthrough all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. agamemnonled them on, and slew first bienor, a leader of his people, andafterwards his comrade and charioteer oileus, who sprang from hischariot and was coming full towards him; but agamemnon struck him onthe forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail againstthe weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains werebattered in and he was killed in full fight.agamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with theirbreasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. he then went on to killisus and antiphus two sons of priam, the one a bastard, the other bornin wedlock; they were in the same chariot--the bastard driving, whilenoble antiphus fought beside him. achilles had once taken both of themprisoners in the glades of ida, and had bound them with fresh withes asthey were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now,however, agamemnon son of atreus smote isus in the chest above thenipple with his spear, while he struck antiphus hard by the ear andthrew him from his chariot. forthwith he stripped their goodly armourfrom off them and recognized them, for he had already seen them atships when achilles brought them in from ida. as a lion fastens on thefawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing them oftheir tender life while he on his way back to his lair--the hind can donothing for them even though she be close by, for she is in an agony offear, and flies through the thick forest, sweating, and at her utmostspeed before the mighty monster--so, no man of the trojans could helpisus and antiphus, for they were themselves flying in panic before theargives.then king agamemnon took the two sons of antimachus, pisander and bravehippolochus. it was antimachus who had been foremost in preventinghelen's being restored to menelaus, for he was largely bribed byalexandrus; and now agamemnon took his two sons, both in the samechariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand--for they had losthold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear. the son of atreussprang upon them like a lion, and the pair besought him from theirchariot. \"take us alive,\" they cried, \"son of atreus, and you shallreceive a great ransom for us. our father antimachus has great store ofgold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you witha very large ransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships ofthe achaeans.\"with such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but theyheard no pitiful answer in return. \"if,\" said agamemnon, \"you are sonsof antimachus, who once at a council of trojans proposed that menelausand ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be killed and notsuffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul iniquity of yourfather.\"as he spoke he felled pisander from his chariot to the earth, smitinghim on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost upon theground. hippolochus fled, but him too did agamemnon smite; he cut offhis hands and his head--which he sent rolling in among the crowd asthough it were a ball. there he let them both lie, and wherever theranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other achaeans followed.foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them,and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thunderingtramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust from off the plain. kingagamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering on theachaeans. as when some mighty forest is all ablaze--the eddying gustswhirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and are consumedbefore the blast of the flame--even so fell the heads of the flyingtrojans before agamemnon son of atreus, and many a noble pair of steedsdrew an empty chariot along the highways of war, for lack of driverswho were lying on the plain, more useful now to vultures than to theirwives.jove drew hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage and dinof battle; but the son of atreus sped onwards, calling out lustily tothe danaans. they flew on by the tomb of old ilus, son of dardanus, inthe middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree makingalways for the city--the son of atreus still shouting, and with handsall bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the scaean gates andthe oak tree, there they halted and waited for the others to come up.meanwhile the trojans kept on flying over the middle of the plain likea herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them inthe dead of night--he springs on one of them, seizes her neck in thegrip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges himselfupon her entrails--even so did king agamemnon son of atreus pursue thefoe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they fled pell-mell before him.many a man was flung headlong from his chariot by the hand of the sonof atreus, for he wielded his spear with fury.but when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, thefather of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat,thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained ida. he thentold iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him. \"go,\" saidhe, \"fleet iris, and speak thus to hector--say that so long as he seesagamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the trojan ranks, he isto keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but whenagamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to hischariot, then will i vouchsafe him strength to slay till he reach theships and night falls at the going down of the sun.\"iris hearkened and obeyed. down she went to strong ilius from thecrests of ida, and found hector son of priam standing by his chariotand horses. then she said, \"hector son of priam, peer of gods incounsel, father jove has sent me to bear you this message--so long asyou see agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the trojan ranks,you are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,but when agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes tohis chariot, then will jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till youreach the ships, and till night falls at the going down of the sun.\"when she had thus spoken iris left him, and hector sprang full armedfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went abouteverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and stirringthe dread strife of battle. the trojans then wheeled round, and againmet the achaeans, while the argives on their part strengthened theirbattalions. the battle was now in array and they stood face to facewith one another, agamemnon ever pressing forward in his eagerness tobe ahead of all others.tell me now ye muses that dwell in the mansions of olympus, who,whether of the trojans or of their allies, was first to face agamemnon?it was iphidamas son of antenor, a man both brave and of great stature,who was brought up in fertile thrace, the mother of sheep. cisses, hismother's father, brought him up in his own house when he was achild--cisses, father to fair theano. when he reached manhood, cisseswould have kept him there, and was for giving him his daughter inmarriage, but as soon as he had married he set out to fight theachaeans with twelve ships that followed him: these he had left atpercote and had come on by land to ilius. he it was that now metagamemnon son of atreus. when they were close up with one another, theson of atreus missed his aim, and iphidamas hit him on the girdle belowthe cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strengthof arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for thepoint of the spear struck against the silver and was turned aside asthough it had been lead: king agamemnon caught it from his hand, anddrew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he then drew his sword,and killed iphidamas by striking him on the neck. so there the poorfellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed in thedefence of his fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of whom hehad had no joy though he had given much for her: he had given ahundred-head of cattle down, and had promised later on to give athousand sheep and goats mixed, from the countless flocks of which hewas possessed. agamemnon son of atreus then despoiled him, and carriedoff his armour into the host of the achaeans.when noble coon, antenor's eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were hiseyes at the sight of his fallen brother. unseen by agamemnon he gotbeside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his armbelow the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the arm.agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this did heleave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that flew asfleet as the wind, and sprang upon coon who was trying to drag off thebody of his brother--his father's son--by the foot, and was crying forhelp to all the bravest of his comrades; but agamemnon struck him witha bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging the dead bodythrough the press of men under cover of his shield: he then cut off hishead, standing over the body of iphidamas. thus did the sons of antenormeet their fate at the hands of the son of atreus, and go down into thehouse of hades.as long as the blood still welled warm from his wound agamemnon wentabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and withgreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and thewound grew dry, the pain became great. as the sharp pangs which theeilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of juno and dispensersof cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour--even so sharpwere the pangs of the son of atreus. he sprang on to his chariot, andbade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in great agony. witha loud clear voice he shouted to the danaans, \"my friends, princes andcounsellors of the argives, defend the ships yourselves, for jove hasnot suffered me to fight the whole day through against the trojans.\"with this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and theyflew forward nothing loth. their chests were white with foam and theirbellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of the battle.when hector saw agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the trojans andlycians saying, \"trojans, lycians, and dardanian warriors, be men, myfriends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their best man hasleft them, and jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph; charge the foewith your chariots that you may win still greater glory.\"with these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a huntsmanhounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did hector,peer of mars, hound the proud trojans on against the achaeans. full ofhope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight like somefierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its deep bluewaters into fury.what, then is the full tale of those whom hector son of priam killed inthe hour of triumph which jove then vouchsafed him? first asaeus,autonous, and opites; dolops son of clytius, opheltius and agelaus;aesymnus, orus and hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains ofthe achaeans did hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and file.as when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south and beatsthem down with the fierceness of its fury--the waves of the sea rollhigh, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the wanderingwind--even so thick were the heads of them that fell by the hand ofhector.all had then been lost and no help for it, and the achaeans would havefled pell-mell to their ships, had not ulysses cried out to diomed,\"son of tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget ourprowess? come, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we shallbe shamed for ever if hector takes the ships.\"and diomed answered, \"come what may, i will stand firm; but we shallhave scant joy of it, for jove is minded to give victory to the trojansrather than to us.\"with these words he struck thymbraeus from his chariot to the ground,smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while ulysses killedmolion who was his squire. these they let lie, now that they hadstopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on playing havoc withthe foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the hounds thathunt them. thus did they turn upon the trojans and slay them, and theachaeans were thankful to have breathing time in their flight fromhector.they then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of meropsof percote, who excelled all others in the arts of divination. he hadforbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would not obey him, forfate lured them to their fall. diomed son of tydeus slew them both andstripped them of their armour, while ulysses killed hippodamus andhypeirochus.and now the son of saturn as he looked down from ida ordained thatneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing oneanother. the son of tydeus speared agastrophus son of paeon in thehip-joint with his spear. his chariot was not at hand for him to flywith, so blindly confident had he been. his squire was in charge of itat some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost untilhe lost his life. hector soon marked the havoc diomed and ulysses weremaking, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by the trojanranks; brave diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and said to ulysseswho was beside him, \"great hector is bearing down upon us and we shallbe undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.\"he poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss hismark. he had aimed at hector's head near the top of his helmet, butbronze was turned by bronze, and hector was untouched, for the spearwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal, whichphoebus apollo had given him. hector sprang back with a great boundunder cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself withhis brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had fallen on hiseyes. the son of tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among theforemost fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the ground;meanwhile hector recovered himself and springing back into his chariotmingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life. but diomedmade at him with his spear and said, \"dog, you have again got awaythough death was close on your heels. phoebus apollo, to whom i weenyou pray ere you go into battle, has again saved you, nevertheless iwill meet you and make an end of you hereafter, if there is any god whowill stand by me too and be my helper. for the present i must pursuethose i can lay hands on.\"as he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of paeon, butalexandrus husband of lovely helen aimed an arrow at him, leaningagainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to ilus son ofdardanus, a ruler in days of old. diomed had taken the cuirass from offthe breast of agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the shield fromoff his shoulders, when paris drew his bow and let fly an arrow thatsped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat of diomed's rightfoot, going right through it and fixing itself in the ground. thereonparis with a hearty laugh sprang forward from his hiding-place, andtaunted him saying, \"you are wounded--my arrow has not been shot invain; would that it had hit you in the belly and killed you, for thusthe trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion, would have had a trucefrom evil.\"diomed all undaunted answered, \"archer, you who without your bow arenothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in singlecombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serveyou in little stead. vain is your boast in that you have scratched thesole of my foot. i care no more than if a girl or some silly boy hadhit me. a worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when i wounda man though i but graze his skin it is another matter, for my weaponwill lay him low. his wife will tear her cheeks for grief and hischildren will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening the earthwith his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him.\"thus he spoke, but ulysses came up and stood over him. under this coverhe sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the pain hesuffered as he did so. then he sprang on to his chariot and bade thecharioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.ulysses was now alone; not one of the argives stood by him, for theywere all panic-stricken. \"alas,\" said he to himself in his dismay,\"what will become of me? it is ill if i turn and fly before these odds,but it will be worse if i am left alone and taken prisoner, for the sonof saturn has struck the rest of the danaans with panic. but why talkto myself in this way? well do i know that though cowards quit thefield, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand firm and holdhis own.\"while he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the trojans advanced andhemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to rue it. as hounds andlusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair whettinghis white tusks--they attack him from every side and can hear thegnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold theirground--even so furiously did the trojans attack ulysses. first hesprang spear in hand upon deiopites and wounded him on the shoulderwith a downward blow; then he killed thoon and ennomus. after these hestruck chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had just sprungdown from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutched the earth inthe hollow of his hand. these he let lie, and went on to wound charopsson of hippasus own brother to noble socus. socus, hero that he was,made all speed to help him, and when he was close to ulysses he said,\"far-famed ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil, this day you shalleither boast of having killed both the sons of hippasus and strippedthem of their armour, or you shall fall before my spear.\"with these words he struck the shield of ulysses. the spear wentthrough the shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass,tearing the flesh from his side, but pallas minerva did not suffer itto pierce the entrails of the hero. ulysses knew that his hour was notyet come, but he gave ground and said to socus, \"wretch, you shall nowsurely die. you have stayed me from fighting further with the trojans,but you shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory to myself, and yoursoul to hades of the noble steeds.\"socus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him inthe back midway between the shoulders, and went right through hischest. he fell heavily to the ground and ulysses vaunted over himsaying, \"o socus, son of hippasus tamer of horses, death has been tooquick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not even indeath shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the raveningvultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their dark wings anddevour you. whereas even though i fall the achaeans will give me my duerites of burial.\"so saying he drew socus's heavy spear out of his flesh and from hisshield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so thathe was much dismayed. when the trojans saw that ulysses was bleedingthey raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; hetherefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him.thrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did bravemenelaus hear him; he turned, therefore, to ajax who was close besidehim and said, \"ajax, noble son of telamon, captain of your people, thecry of ulysses rings in my ears, as though the trojans had cut him offand were worsting him while he is single-handed. let us make our waythrough the throng; it will be well that we defend him; i fear he maycome to harm for all his valour if he be left without support, and thedanaans would miss him sorely.\"he led the way and mighty ajax went with him. the trojans had gatheredround ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the carcase of somehorned stag that has been hit with an arrow--the stag has fled at fullspeed so long as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted, butwhen the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him in theshady glades of the forest. then heaven sends a fierce lion thither,whereon the jackals fly in terror and the lion robs them of theirprey--even so did trojans many and brave gather round crafty ulysses,but the hero stood at bay and kept them off with his spear. ajax thencame up with his shield before him like a wall, and stood hard by,whereon the trojans fled in all directions. menelaus took ulysses bythe hand, and led him out of the press while his squire brought up hischariot, but ajax rushed furiously on the trojans and killed doryclus,a bastard son of priam; then he wounded pandocus, lysandrus, pyrasus,and pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes rushing in full flood fromthe mountains on to the plain, big with the rain of heaven--many a dryoak and many a pine does it engulf, and much mud does it bring down andcast into the sea--even so did brave ajax chase the foe furiously overthe plain, slaying both men and horses.hector did not yet know what ajax was doing, for he was fighting on theextreme left of the battle by the banks of the river scamander, wherethe carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round nestor and braveidomeneus. among these hector was making great slaughter with his spearand furious driving, and was destroying the ranks that were opposed tohim; still the achaeans would have given no ground, had not alexandrushusband of lovely helen stayed the prowess of machaon, shepherd of hispeople, by wounding him in the right shoulder with a triple-barbedarrow. the achaeans were in great fear that as the fight had turnedagainst them the trojans might take him prisoner, and idomeneus said tonestor, \"nestor son of neleus, honour to the achaean name, mount yourchariot at once; take machaon with you and drive your horses to theships as fast as you can. a physician is worth more than several othermen put together, for he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs.\"nestor knight of gerene did as idomeneus had counselled; he at oncemounted his chariot, and machaon son of the famed physicianaesculapius, went with him. he lashed his horses and they flew onwardnothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own free will.then cebriones seeing the trojans in confusion said to hector from hisplace beside him, \"hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme wingof the battle, while the other trojans are in pell-mell rout, they andtheir horses. ajax son of telamon is driving them before him; i knowhim by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot and horsesthither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately, and wherethe cry of battle is loudest.\"with this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip theydrew the chariot full speed among the achaeans and trojans, over thebodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was bespatteredwith blood, and the rail round the car was covered with splashes bothfrom the horses' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels. hector torehis way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and hispresence threw the danaans into confusion, for his spear was not longidle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword and spear,and throwing great stones, he avoided ajax son of telamon, for jovewould have been angry with him if he had fought a better man thanhimself.then father jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart ofajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behindhim--looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were somewild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowlybackwards. as peasants with their hounds chase a lion from theirstockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick oftheir herd--he makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts frommany a strong hand fall thick around him, with burning brands thatscare him for all his fury, and when morning comes he slinks foiled andangry away--even so did ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrilybefore the trojans, fearing for the ships of the achaeans. or as somelazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken about his back, when he intoa field begins eating the corn--boys beat him but he is too many forthem, and though they lay about with their sticks they cannot hurt him;still when he has had his fill they at last drive him from thefield--even so did the trojans and their allies pursue great ajax, eversmiting the middle of his shield with their darts. now and again hewould turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions of the trojans,and then he would again retreat; but he prevented any of them frommaking his way to the ships. single-handed he stood midway between thetrojans and achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck someof them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for hisblood, fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding ofhis fair flesh.now when eurypylus the brave son of euaemon saw that ajax was beingoverpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and hurled hisspear. he struck apisaon son of phausius in the liver below themidriff, and laid him low. eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped thearmour from his shoulders; but when alexandrus saw him, he aimed anarrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow broke, butthe point that was left in the wound dragged on the thigh; he drewback, therefore, under cover of his comrades to save his life, shoutingas he did so to the danaans, \"my friends, princes and counsellors ofthe argives, rally to the defence of ajax who is being overpowered, andi doubt whether he will come out of the fight alive. hither, then, tothe rescue of great ajax son of telamon.\"even so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came near,and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from theirshoulders so as to give him cover. ajax then made towards them, andturned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men.thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. meanwhile the maresof neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing nestor out of thefight, and with him machaon shepherd of his people. achilles saw andtook note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship watching thehard stress and struggle of the fight. he called from the ship to hiscomrade patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came out looking likemars himself--here indeed was the beginning of the ill that presentlybefell him. \"why,\" said he, \"achilles, do you call me? what do you wantwith me?\" and achilles answered, \"noble son of menoetius, man after myown heart, i take it that i shall now have the achaeans praying at myknees, for they are in great straits; go, patroclus, and ask nestor whoit is that he is bearing away wounded from the field; from his back ishould say it was machaon son of aesculapius, but i could not see hisface for the horses went by me at full speed.\"patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off runningby the ships and tents of the achaeans.when nestor and machaon had reached the tents of the son of neleus,they dismounted, and an esquire, eurymedon, took the horses from thechariot. the pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry thesweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they came inside andtook their seats. fair hecamede, whom nestor had had awarded to himfrom tenedos when achilles took it, mixed them a mess; she was daughterof wise arsinous, and the achaeans had given her to nestor because heexcelled all of them in counsel. first she set for them a fair andwell-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel ofbronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakesof barley-meal. there was also a cup of rare workmanship which the oldman had brought with him from home, studded with bosses of gold; it hadfour handles, on each of which there were two golden doves feeding, andit had two feet to stand on. any one else would hardly have been ableto lift it from the table when it was full, but nestor could do soquite easily. in this the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them amess with pramnian wine; she grated goat's milk cheese into it with abronze grater, threw in a handful of white barley-meal, and having thusprepared the mess she bade them drink it. when they had done so and hadthus quenched their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and atthis moment patroclus appeared at the door.when the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand, ledhim into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; butpatroclus stood where he was and said, \"noble sir, i may not stay, youcannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be trifledwith, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you were bearingaway from the field. i can now see for myself that he is machaon,shepherd of his people. i must go back and tell achilles. you, sir,know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even where noblame should lie.\"and nestor answered, \"why should achilles care to know how many of theachaeans may be wounded? he recks not of the dismay that reigns in ourhost; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave diomed, son oftydeus, is wounded; so are ulysses and agamemnon; eurypylus has beenhit with an arrow in the thigh, and i have just been bringing this manfrom the field--he too wounded with an arrow. nevertheless, achilles,so valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. will he wait tillthe ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one upon theother? as for me, i have no strength nor stay in me any longer; wouldthat i were still young and strong as in the days when there was afight between us and the men of elis about some cattle-raiding. i thenkilled itymoneus, the valiant son of hypeirochus, a dweller in elis, asi was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown by my handwhile fighting in the front rank in defence of his cows, so he fell andthe country people around him were in great fear. we drove off a vastquantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle and as manyflocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and as many wide-spreadingflocks of goats. of horses, moreover, we seized a hundred and fifty,all of them mares, and many had foals running with them. all these didwe drive by night to pylus, the city of neleus, taking them within thecity; and the heart of neleus was glad in that i had taken so much,though it was the first time i had ever been in the field. at daybreakthe heralds went round crying that all in elis to whom there was a debtowing should come; and the leading pylians assembled to divide thespoils. there were many to whom the epeans owed chattels, for we men ofpylus were few and had been oppressed with wrong; in former yearshercules had come, and had laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all ourbest men had perished. neleus had had twelve sons, but i alone wasleft; the others had all been killed. the epeans presuming upon allthis had looked down upon us and had done us much evil. my father chosea herd of cattle and a great flock of sheep--three hundred in all--andhe took their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to himin elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. they and their chariotswith them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but kingaugeas took them, and sent back their driver grieving for the loss ofhis horses. neleus was angered by what he had both said and done, andtook great value in return, but he divided the rest, that no man mighthave less than his full share.\"thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the godsthroughout the city; but three days afterwards the epeans came in abody, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and withthem the two moliones in their armour, though they were still lads andunused to fighting. now there is a certain town, thryoessa, perchedupon a rock on the river alpheus, the border city of pylus. this theywould destroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they hadcrossed their whole plain, minerva darted down by night from olympusand bade us set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiers inpylos, for the men meant fighting. neleus would not let me arm, and hidmy horses, for he said that as yet i could know nothing about war;nevertheless minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as i was, ifought among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them.there is a river minyeius that falls into the sea near arene, and therethey that were mounted (and i with them) waited till morning, when thecompanies of foot soldiers came up with us in force. thence in fullpanoply and equipment we came towards noon to the sacred waters of thealpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty jove, with a bull toalpheus, another to neptune, and a herd-heifer to minerva. after thiswe took supper in our companies, and laid us down to rest each in hisarmour by the river.\"the epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take it,but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for them.when the sun's rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle,praying to jove and to minerva, and when the fight had begun, i was thefirst to kill my man and take his horses--to wit the warrior mulius. hewas son-in-law to augeas, having married his eldest daughter,golden-haired agamede, who knew the virtues of every herb which growsupon the face of the earth. i speared him as he was coming towards me,and when he fell headlong in the dust, i sprang upon his chariot andtook my place in the front ranks. the epeans fled in all directionswhen they saw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had)laid low, and i swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fiftychariots--and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear.i should have even killed the two moliones, sons of actor, unless theirreal father, neptune lord of the earthquake, had hidden them in a thickmist and borne them out of the fight. thereon jove vouchsafed thepylians a great victory, for we chased them far over the plain, killingthe men and bringing in their armour, till we had brought our horses tobuprasium, rich in wheat, and to the olenian rock, with the hill thatis called alision, at which point minerva turned the people back. therei slew the last man and left him; then the achaeans drove their horsesback from buprasium to pylos and gave thanks to jove among the gods,and among mortal men to nestor.\"such was i among my peers, as surely as ever was, but achilles is forkeeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it hereafterwhen the host is being cut to pieces. my good friend, did not menoetiuscharge you thus, on the day when he sent you from phthia to agamemnon?ulysses and i were in the house, inside, and heard all that he said toyou; for we came to the fair house of peleus while beating up recruitsthroughout all achaea, and when we got there we found menoetius andyourself, and achilles with you. the old knight peleus was in the outercourt, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to jove the lord ofthunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which he poureddrink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. you two were busycutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood at the gates,whereon achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the hand into the house,placed us at table, and set before us such hospitable entertainment asguests expect. when we had satisfied ourselves with meat and drink, isaid my say and urged both of you to join us. you were ready enough todo so, and the two old men charged you much and straitly. old peleusbade his son achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie hispeers, while menoetius the son of actor spoke thus to you: 'my son,'said he, 'achilles is of nobler birth than you are, but you are olderthan he, though he is far the better man of the two. counsel himwisely, guide him in the right way, and he will follow you to his ownprofit.' thus did your father charge you, but you have forgotten;nevertheless, even now, say all this to achilles if he will listen toyou. who knows but with heaven's help you may talk him over, for it isgood to take a friend's advice. if, however, he is fearful about someoracle, or if his mother has told him something from jove, then let himsend you, and let the rest of the myrmidons follow with you, ifperchance you may bring light and saving to the danaans. and let himsend you into battle clad in his own armour, that the trojans maymistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the achaeansmay thus have time to get their breath, for they are hard pressed andthere is little breathing time in battle. you, who are fresh, mighteasily drive a tired enemy back to his walls and away from the tentsand ships.\"with these words he moved the heart of patroclus, who set off runningby the line of the ships to achilles, descendant of aeacus. when he hadgot as far as the ships of ulysses, where was their place of assemblyand court of justice, with their altars dedicated to the gods,eurypylus son of euaemon, met him, wounded in the thigh with an arrow,and limping out of the fight. sweat rained from his head and shoulders,and black blood welled from his cruel wound, but his mind did notwander. the son of menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon himand spoke piteously saying, \"o unhappy princes and counsellors of thedanaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds of troy with your fat,far from your friends and your native land? say, noble eurypylus, willthe achaeans be able to hold great hector in check, or will they fallnow before his spear?\"wounded eurypylus made answer, \"noble patroclus, there is no hope leftfor the achaeans but they will perish at their ships. all they thatwere princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the hands ofthe trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. but save me and takeme to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash the black bloodfrom off it with warm water, and lay upon it those gracious herbswhich, so they say, have been shown you by achilles, who was himselfshown them by chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs. for of thephysicians podalirius and machaon, i hear that the one is lying woundedin his tent and is himself in need of healing, while the other isfighting the trojans upon the plain.\"\"hero eurypylus,\" replied the brave son of menoetius, \"how may thesethings be? what can i do? i am on my way to bear a message to nobleachilles from nestor of gerene, bulwark of the achaeans, but even so iwill not be unmindful of your distress.\"with this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,and a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground forhim to lie on. he laid him at full length and cut out the sharp arrowfrom his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with warmwater; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his hands, andspread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which killed allpain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off flowing.book xii  the trojans and their allies break the wall, led on by hector.so the son of menoetius was attending to the hurt of eurypylus withinthe tent, but the argives and trojans still fought desperately, norwere the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the trojans incheck longer. they had built it to protect their ships, and had dug thetrench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and the richspoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs to thegods. it had been built without the consent of the immortals, andtherefore it did not last. so long as hector lived and achilles nursedhis anger, and so long as the city of priam remained untaken, the greatwall of the achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of the trojanswere no more, and many also of the argives, though some were yet leftalive--when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenth year, and theargives had gone back with their ships to their own country--thenneptune and apollo took counsel to destroy the wall, and they turned onto it the streams of all the rivers from mount ida into the sea,rhesus, heptaporus, caresus, rhodius, grenicus, aesopus, and goodlyscamander, with simois, where many a shield and helm had fallen, andmany a hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust. phoebus apolloturned the mouths of all these rivers together and made them flow fornine days against the wall, while jove rained the whole time that hemight wash it sooner into the sea. neptune himself, trident in hand,surveyed the work and threw into the sea all the foundations of beamsand stones which the achaeans had laid with so much toil; he made alllevel by the mighty stream of the hellespont, and then when he hadswept the wall away he spread a great beach of sand over the placewhere it had been. this done he turned the rivers back into their oldcourses.this was what neptune and apollo were to do in after time; but as yetbattle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its timbersrang under the blows that rained upon them. the argives, cowed by thescourge of jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of hector themighty minister of rout, who as heretofore fought with the force andfury of a whirlwind. as a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on the dogsand men that attack him, while these form a solid wall and shower theirjavelins as they face him--his courage is all undaunted, but his highspirit will be the death of him; many a time does he charge at hispursuers to scatter them, and they fall back as often as he doesso--even so did hector go about among the host exhorting his men, andcheering them on to cross the trench.but the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink, forthe width frightened them. they could neither jump it nor cross it, forit had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above which therewere the sharp stakes that the sons of the achaeans had planted soclose and strong as a defence against all who would assail it; a horse,therefore, could not get into it and draw his chariot after him, butthose who were on foot kept trying their very utmost. then polydamaswent up to hector and said, \"hector, and you other captains of thetrojans and allies, it is madness for us to try and drive our horsesacross the trench; it will be very hard to cross, for it is full ofsharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall. our horses thereforecannot get down into it, and would be of no use if they did; moreoverit is a narrow place and we should come to harm. if, indeed, great joveis minded to help the trojans, and in his anger will utterly destroythe achaeans, i would myself gladly see them perish now and here farfrom argos; but if they should rally and we are driven back from theships pell-mell into the trench there will be not so much as a man getback to the city to tell the tale. now, therefore, let us all do as isay; let our squires hold our horses by the trench, but let us followhector in a body on foot, clad in full armour, and if the day of theirdoom is at hand the achaeans will not be able to withstand us.\"thus spoke polydamas and his saying pleased hector, who sprang in fullarmour to the ground, and all the other trojans, when they saw him doso, also left their chariots. each man then gave his horses over to hischarioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at the trench. thenthey formed themselves into companies, made themselves ready, and infive bodies followed their leaders. those that went with hector andpolydamas were the bravest and most in number, and the most determinedto break through the wall and fight at the ships. cebriones was alsojoined with them as third in command, for hector had left his chariotin charge of a less valiant soldier. the next company was led by paris,alcathous, and agenor; the third by helenus and deiphobus, two sons ofpriam, and with them was the hero asius--asius, the son of hyrtacus,whose great black horses of the breed that comes from the river selleishad brought him from arisbe. aeneas, the valiant son of anchises, ledthe fourth; he and the two sons of antenor, archelochus and acamas, menwell versed in all the arts of war. sarpedon was captain over theallies, and took with him glaucus and asteropaeus whom he deemed mostvaliant after himself--for he was far the best man of them all. thesehelped to array one another in their ox-hide shields, and then chargedstraight at the danaans, for they felt sure that they would not holdout longer and that they should themselves now fall upon the ships.the rest of the trojans and their allies now followed the counsel ofpolydamas but asius, son of hyrtacus, would not leave his horses andhis esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with himtowards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in consequence.nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten ilius, exulting in hischariot and his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened namehad overshadowed him and he had fallen by the spear of idomeneus thenoble son of deucalion. he had driven towards the left wing of theships, by which way the achaeans used to return with their chariots andhorses from the plain. hither he drove and found the gates with theirdoors opened wide, and the great bar down--for the gatemen kept themopen so as to let those of their comrades enter who might be flyingtowards the ships. hither of set purpose did he direct his horses, andhis men followed him with a loud cry, for they felt sure that theachaeans would not hold out longer, and that they should now fall uponthe ships. little did they know that at the gates they should find twoof the bravest chieftains, proud sons of the fighting lapithae--theone, polypoetes, mighty son of pirithous, and the other leonteus, peerof murderous mars. these stood before the gates like two high oak treesupon the mountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, andyear after year battle with wind and rain--even so did these two menawait the onset of great asius confidently and without flinching. thetrojans led by him and by iamenus, orestes, adamas the son of asius,thoon and oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made straight forthe wall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for awhile the two defenders remained inside and cheered the achaeans on tostand firm in the defence of their ships; when, however, they saw thatthe trojans were attacking the wall, while the danaans were crying outfor help and being routed, they rushed outside and fought in front ofthe gates like two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attackof men and dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood allround them tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the clatteringof their tusks, till some one hits them and makes an end of them--evenso did the gleaming bronze rattle about their breasts, as the weaponsfell upon them; for they fought with great fury, trusting to their ownprowess and to those who were on the wall above them. these threw greatstones at their assailants in defence of themselves their tents andtheir ships. the stones fell thick as the flakes of snow which somefierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down in sheetsupon the earth--even so fell the weapons from the hands alike oftrojans and achaeans. helmet and shield rang out as the great stonesrained upon them, and asius, the son of hyrtacus, in his dismay criedaloud and smote his two thighs. \"father jove,\" he cried, \"of a truthyou too are altogether given to lying. i made sure the argive heroescould not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted wasps, or bees thathave their nests in the rocks by the wayside--they leave not the holeswherein they have built undefended, but fight for their little onesagainst all who would take them--even so these men, though they be buttwo, will not be driven from the gates, but stand firm either to slayor be slain.\"he spoke, but moved not the mind of jove, whose counsel it then was togive glory to hector. meanwhile the rest of the trojans were fightingabout the other gates; i, however, am no god to be able to tell aboutall these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the stone wallas it were a fiery furnace. the argives, discomfited though they were,were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who were defendingthe achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the lapithae kept on fightingwith might and main.thereon polypoetes, mighty son of pirithous, hit damasus with a spearupon his cheek-pierced helmet. the helmet did not protect him, for thepoint of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so that thebrain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. he then slewpylon and ormenus. leonteus, of the race of mars, killed hippomachusthe son of antimachus by striking him with his spear upon the girdle.he then drew his sword and sprang first upon antiphates whom he killedin combat, and who fell face upwards on the earth. after him he killedmenon, iamenus, and orestes, and laid them low one after the other.while they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the youthswho were led on by polydamas and hector (and these were the greaterpart and the most valiant of those that were trying to break throughthe wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the trench,uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a sign from heavenwhen they had essayed to cross it--a soaring eagle that flew skirtingthe left wing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snake in itstalons still alive and struggling to escape. the snake was still benton revenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it struck thebird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being inpain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and thenflew down the wind with a sharp cry. the trojans were struck withterror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing jove, writhingin the midst of them, and polydamas went up to hector and said,\"hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke me, evenwhen i speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth, that one ofthe people should cross your will either in the field or at the councilboard; you would have them support you always: nevertheless i will saywhat i think will be best; let us not now go on to fight the danaans attheir ships, for i know what will happen if this soaring eagle whichskirted the left wing of our host with a monstrous blood-red snake inits talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent as an omen tothe trojans on their essaying to cross the trench. the eagle let go herhold; she did not succeed in taking it home to her little ones, and sowill it be--with ourselves; even though by a mighty effort we breakthrough the gates and wall of the achaeans, and they give way beforeus, still we shall not return in good order by the way we came, butshall leave many a man behind us whom the achaeans will do to death indefence of their ships. thus would any seer who was expert in thesematters, and was trusted by the people, read the portent.\"hector looked fiercely at him and said, \"polydamas, i like not of yourreading. you can find a better saying than this if you will. if,however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbedyou of your reason. you would have me pay no heed to the counsels ofjove, nor to the promises he made me--and he bowed his head inconfirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl.what care i whether they fly towards dawn or dark, and whether they beon my right hand or on my left? let us put our trust rather in thecounsel of great jove, king of mortals and immortals. there is oneomen, and one only--that a man should fight for his country. why areyou so fearful? though we be all of us slain at the ships of theargives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you are notsteadfast nor courageous. if you will not fight, or would talk othersover from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my spear.\"with these words he led the way, and the others followed after with acry that rent the air. then jove the lord of thunder sent the blast ofa mighty wind from the mountains of ida, that bore the dust downtowards the ships; he thus lulled the achaeans into security, and gavevictory to hector and to the trojans, who, trusting to their own mightand to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break through the greatwall of the achaeans. they tore down the breastworks from the walls,and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved the buttresses, which theachaeans had set in front of the wall in order to support it; when theyhad pulled these down they made sure of breaking through the wall, butthe danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they still fencedthe battlements with their shields of ox-hide, and hurled theirmissiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the wall.the two ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on theachaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any onewhom they saw to be remiss. \"my friends,\" they cried, \"argives one andall--good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet, in whichall were of equal prowess--there is now work enough, as you very wellknow, for all of you. see that you none of you turn in flight towardsthe ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press forward andkeep one another in heart, if it may so be that olympian jove the lordof lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive them backtowards the city.\"thus did the two go about shouting and cheering the achaeans on. as theflakes that fall thick upon a winter's day, when jove is minded to snowand to display these his arrows to mankind--he lulls the wind to rest,and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of the highmountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy plains, andthe tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the forelands, andhavens of the grey sea, but the waves as they come rolling in stay itthat it can come no further, though all else is wrapped as with amantle, so heavy are the heavens with snow--even thus thickly did thestones fall on one side and on the other, some thrown at the trojans,and some by the trojans at the achaeans; and the whole wall was in anuproar.still the trojans and brave hector would not yet have broken down thegates and the great bar, had not jove turned his son sarpedon againstthe argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle. before him heheld his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith had beaten so fairand round, and had lined with ox hides which he had made fast withrivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in front of him, andbrandishing his two spears came on like some lion of the wilderness,who has been long famished for want of meat and will dare break eveninto a well-fenced homestead to try and get at the sheep. he may findthe shepherds keeping watch over their flocks with dogs and spears, buthe is in no mind to be driven from the fold till he has had a try forit; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it off, or be hit by aspear from some strong hand--even so was sarpedon fain to attack thewall and break down its battlements. then he said to glaucus son ofhippolochus, \"glaucus, why in lycia do we receive especial honour asregards our place at table? why are the choicest portions served us andour cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us as though we weregods? moreover we hold a large estate by the banks of the riverxanthus, fair with orchard lawns and wheat-growing land; it becomes us,therefore, to take our stand at the head of all the lycians and bearthe brunt of the fight, that one may say to another, 'our princes inlycia eat the fat of the land and drink best of wine, but they are finefellows; they fight well and are ever at the front in battle.' my goodfriend, if, when we were once out of this fight, we could escape oldage and death thenceforward and forever, i should neither press forwardmyself nor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand shapes hangs everover our heads, and no man can elude him; therefore let us go forwardand either win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another.\"glaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host oflycians. menestheus son of peteos was dismayed when he saw them, for itwas against his part of the wall that they came--bringing destructionwith them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain to support hiscomrades and saw the two ajaxes, men ever eager for the fray, andteucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them; but hecould not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an uproarwas there from crashing shields and helmets and the battering of gateswith a din which reached the skies. for all the gates had been closed,and the trojans were hammering at them to try and break their waythrough them. menestheus, therefore, sent thootes with a message toajax. \"run, good thootes,\" he said, \"and call ajax, or better still bidboth come, for it will be all over with us here directly; the leadersof the lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought desperatelyheretofore. but if they have too much on their hands to let them come,at any rate let ajax son of telamon do so, and let teucer, the famousbowman, come with him.\"the messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall ofthe achaeans. when he reached the ajaxes he said to them, \"sirs,princes of the argives, the son of noble peteos bids you come to himfor a while and help him. you had better both come if you can, or itwill be all over with him directly; the leaders of the lycians are uponhim, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you have toomuch on your hands to let both come, at any rate let ajax, son oftelamon, do so, and let teucer, the famous bowman, come with him.\"great ajax son of telamon heeded the message, and at once spoke to theson of oileus. \"ajax,\" said he, \"do you two, yourself and bravelycomedes, stay here and keep the danaans in heart to fight theirhardest. i will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but iwill come back here at once as soon as i have given them the help theyneed.\"with this, ajax son of telamon set off, and teucer, his brother by thesame father, went also, with pandion to carry teucer's bow. they wentalong inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where menestheuswas (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave captains andleaders of the lycians were storming the battlements as it were a thickdark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising the battle-cryaloud.first, ajax son of telamon killed brave epicles, a comrade of sarpedon,hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the battlements at the verytop of the wall. as men now are, even one who is in the bloom of youthcould hardly lift it with his two hands, but ajax raised it high aloftand flung it down, smashing epicles' four-crested helmet so that thebones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell from the highwall as though he were diving, with no more life left in him. thenteucer wounded glaucus the brave son of hippolochus as he was coming onto attack the wall. he saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it,which made glaucus leave off fighting. thereon he sprang covertly downfor fear some of the achaeans might see that he was wounded and taunthim. sarpedon was stung with grief when he saw glaucus leave him, stillhe did not leave off fighting, but aimed his spear at alcmaon the sonof thestor and hit him. he drew his spear back again and alcmaon camedown headlong after it with his bronzed armour rattling round him. thensarpedon seized the battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at ittill it all gave way together, and a breach was made through which manymight pass.ajax and teucer then both of them attacked him. teucer hit him with anarrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body, but jovesaved his son from destruction that he might not fall by the ships'sterns. meanwhile ajax sprang on him and pierced his shield, but thespear did not go clean through, though it hustled him back that hecould come on no further. he therefore retired a little space from thebattlement, yet without losing all his ground, for he still thought tocover himself with glory. then he turned round and shouted to the bravelycians saying, \"lycians, why do you thus fail me? for all my prowess icannot break through the wall and open a way to the shipssingle-handed. come close on behind me, for the more there are of usthe better.\"the lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who wastheir counsellor and their king. the argives on their part got theirmen in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly strugglebetween them. the lycians could not break through the wall and forcetheir way to the ships, nor could the danaans drive the lycians fromthe wall now that they had once reached it. as two men, measuring-rodsin hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own incommon, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a merestrip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone of contention,and they beat one another's round shields for their possession. many aman's body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round andbared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through theirshields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged with theblood alike of trojans and of achaeans. but even so the trojans couldnot rout the achaeans, who still held on; and as some honesthard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scalesbe true, for she would gain some pitiful earnings for her little ones,even so was the fight balanced evenly between them till the time camewhen jove gave the greater glory to hector son of priam, who was firstto spring towards the wall of the achaeans. when he had done so, hecried aloud to the trojans, \"up, trojans, break the wall of theargives, and fling fire upon their ships.\"thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at thewall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with sharpspears in their hands. hector laid hold of a stone that lay justoutside the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other;two of the best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise itfrom the ground and put it on to a waggon, but hector lifted it quiteeasily by himself, for the son of scheming saturn made it light forhim. as a shepherd picks up a ram's fleece with one hand and finds itno burden, so easily did hector lift the great stone and drive it rightat the doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. thesedoors were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars towhich there was but one key. when he had got close up to them, hectorstrode towards them that his blow might gain in force and struck themin the middle, leaning his whole weight against them. he broke bothhinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its great weight. theportals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and thedoors flew open, one one way, and the other the other, through theforce of the blow. then brave hector leaped inside with a face as darkas that of flying night. the gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about hisbody and he had two spears in his hand. none but a god could havewithstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glaredlike fire. then he turned round towards the trojans and called on themto scale the wall, and they did as he bade them--some of them at onceclimbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates. thedanaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all wasuproar and confusion.book xiii  neptune helps the achaeans--the feats of idomeneus--hector at  the ships.now when jove had thus brought hector and the trojans to the ships, heleft them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen eyes away,looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of thrace, the mysians,fighters at close quarters, the noble hippemolgi, who live on milk, andthe abians, justest of mankind. he no longer turned so much as a glancetowards troy, for he did not think that any of the immortals would goand help either trojans or danaans.but king neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been lookingadmiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of woodedsamothrace, whence he could see all ida, with the city of priam and theships of the achaeans. he had come from under the sea and taken hisplace here, for he pitied the achaeans who were being overcome by thetrojans; and he was furiously angry with jove.presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as hestrode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath thetread of his immortal feet. three strides he took, and with the fourthhe reached his goal--aegae, where is his glittering golden palace,imperishable, in the depths of the sea. when he got there, he yoked hisfleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all flying in thewind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped his gold whip, andtook his stand upon his chariot. as he went his way over the waves thesea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and camegambolling round him from every quarter of the deep, while the sea inher gladness opened a path before his chariot. so lightly did thehorses fly that the bronze axle of the car was not even wet beneath it;and thus his bounding steeds took him to the ships of the achaeans.now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midwaybetween tenedos and rocky imbrus; here neptune lord of the earthquakestayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosialforage. he hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none couldeither unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that placeuntil their lord should return. this done he went his way to the hostof the achaeans.now the trojans followed hector son of priam in close array like astorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raisingthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of theachaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there. meanwhileearth-encircling neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the argives,for he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice ofcalchas.first he spoke to the two ajaxes, who were doing their best already,and said, \"ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the achaeans if youwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. i amnot afraid that the trojans, who have got over the wall in force, willbe victorious in any other part, for the achaeans can hold all of themin check, but i much fear that some evil will befall us here wherefurious hector, who boasts himself the son of great jove himself, isleading them on like a pillar of flame. may some god, then, put it intoyour hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do thelike. in this case you will drive him from the ships even though he beinspired by jove himself.\"as he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck both ofthem with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring. he madetheir legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. then,as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer rock,and presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even sodid neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air andleave them. of the two, swift ajax son of oileus was the first to knowwho it was that had been speaking with them, and said to ajax son oftelamon, \"ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on olympus, who inthe likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our ships. itwas not calchas the seer and diviner of omens; i knew him at once byhis feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods are soon recognised.moreover i feel the lust of battle burn more fiercely within me, whilemy hands and my feet under me are more eager for the fray.\"and ajax son of telamon answered, \"i too feel my hands grasp my spearmore firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble; i long,moreover, to meet furious hector son of priam, even in single combat.\"thus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with whichthe god had filled them. meanwhile the earth-encircler roused theachaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once byhard fighting and by grief at seeing that the trojans had got over thewall in force. tears began falling from their eyes as they beheld them,for they made sure that they should not escape destruction; but thelord of the earthquake passed lightly about among them and urged theirbattalions to the front.first he went up to teucer and leitus, the hero peneleos, and thoas anddeipyrus; meriones also and antilochus, valiant warriors; all did heexhort. \"shame on you young argives,\" he cried, \"it was on your prowessi relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not with might andmain, this very day will see us overcome by the trojans. of a truth myeyes behold a great and terrible portent which i had never thought tosee--the trojans at our ships--they, who were heretofore likepanic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest, withno strength but in flight for they cannot defend themselves. hithertothe trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of the achaeans,but now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at ourvery ships through the cowardice of our leader and the disaffection ofthe people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight indefence of the ships but are being slaughtered near them. true, kingagamemnon son of atreus is the cause of our disaster by having insultedthe son of peleus, still this is no reason why we should leave offfighting. let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave healquickly. you do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest soldiersin our whole army. i blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is aweakling, but i am indignant with such men as you are. my good friends,matters will soon become even worse through this slackness; think, eachone of you, of his own honour and credit, for the hazard of the fightis extreme. great hector is now fighting at our ships; he has brokenthrough the gates and the strong bolt that held them.\"thus did the earth-encircler address the achaeans and urge them on.thereon round the two ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men, ofwhom not even mars nor minerva, marshaller of hosts could make light ifthey went among them, for they were the picked men of all those whowere now awaiting the onset of hector and the trojans. they made aliving fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to buckler,helmet to helmet, and man to man. the horse-hair crests on theirgleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closelyserried were they; the spears they brandished in their strong handswere interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle.the trojans advanced in a dense body, with hector at their headpressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of somemountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; thefoundations of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, andas it bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an uproar;it swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level ground, butthen for all its fury it can go no further--even so easily did hectorfor a while seem as though he would career through the tents and shipsof the achaeans till he had reached the sea in his murderous course;but the closely serried battalions stayed him when he reached them, forthe sons of the achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears pointedat both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered and gaveground; thereon he shouted to the trojans, \"trojans, lycians, anddardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the achaeans have setthemselves as a wall against me, but they will not check me for long;they will give ground before me if the mightiest of the gods, thethundering spouse of juno, has indeed inspired my onset.\"with these words he put heart and soul into them all. deiphobus son ofpriam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with his roundshield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly forward.meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the broadorb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the spear broke intwo pieces long ere he could do so; moreover deiphobus had seen itcoming and had held his shield well away from him. meriones drew backunder cover of his comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquishdeiphobus, and having broken his spear. he turned therefore towards theships and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind in his tent.the others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into theheavens. teucer son of telamon was the first to kill his man, to wit,the warrior imbrius, son of mentor, rich in horses. until the achaeanscame he had lived in pedaeum, and had married medesicaste, a bastarddaughter of priam; but on the arrival of the danaan fleet he had goneback to ilius, and was a great man among the trojans, dwelling nearpriam himself, who gave him like honour with his own sons. the son oftelamon now struck him under the ear with a spear which he then drewback again, and imbrius fell headlong as an ash-tree when it is felledon the crest of some high mountain beacon, and its delicate greenfoliage comes toppling down to the ground. thus did he fall with hisbronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, and teucer sprangforward with intent to strip him of his armour; but as he was doing so,hector took aim at him with a spear. teucer saw the spear coming andswerved aside, whereon it hit amphimachus, son of cteatus son of actor,in the chest as he was coming into battle, and his armour rang rattlinground him as he fell heavily to the ground. hector sprang forward totake amphimachus's helmet from off his temples, and in a moment ajaxthrew a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased allover in his terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss ofhis shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses,which the achaeans then drew off. stichius and menestheus, captains ofthe athenians, bore away amphimachus to the host of the achaeans, whilethe two brave and impetuous ajaxes did the like by imbrius. as twolions snatch a goat from the hounds that have it in their fangs, andbear it through thick brushwood high above the ground in their jaws,thus did the ajaxes bear aloft the body of imbrius, and strip it of itsarmour. then the son of oileus severed the head from the neck inrevenge for the death of amphimachus, and sent it whirling over thecrowd as though it had been a ball, till it fell in the dust athector's feet.neptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson amphimachus should havefallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the achaeans tourge the danaans still further, and to devise evil for the trojans.idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had justcome to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. his fellow-soldiersbore him off the field, and idomeneus having given orders to thephysicians went on to his tent, for he was still thirsting for battle.neptune spoke in the likeness and with the voice of thoas son ofandraemon who ruled the aetolians of all pleuron and high calydon, andwas honoured among his people as though he were a god. \"idomeneus,\"said he, \"lawgiver to the cretans, what has now become of the threatswith which the sons of the achaeans used to threaten the trojans?\"and idomeneus chief among the cretans answered, \"thoas, no one, so faras i know, is in fault, for we can all fight. none are held backneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the will of almightyjove that the achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from argos:you, thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart ifyou see any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to dotheir utmost.\"to this neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, \"idomeneus, may henever return from troy, but remain here for dogs to batten upon, who isthis day wilfully slack in fighting. get your armour and go, we mustmake all haste together if we may be of any use, though we are onlytwo. even cowards gain courage from companionship, and we two can holdour own with the bravest.\"therewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and idomeneuswhen he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped his two spears,and sallied forth. as the lightning which the son of saturn brandishesfrom bright olympus when he would show a sign to mortals, and its gleamflashes far and wide--even so did his armour gleam about him as he ran.meriones his sturdy squire met him while he was still near his tent(for he was going to fetch his spear) and idomeneus said:\"meriones, fleet son of molus, best of comrades, why have you left thefield? are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting you? orhave you been sent to fetch me? i want no fetching; i had far ratherfight than stay in my tent.\"\"idomeneus,\" answered meriones, \"i come for a spear, if i can find onein my tent; i have broken the one i had, in throwing it at the shieldof deiphobus.\"and idomeneus captain of the cretans answered, \"you will find onespear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall ofmy tent. i have taken them from trojans whom i have killed, for i amnot one to keep my enemy at arm's length; therefore i have spears,bossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets.\"then meriones said, \"i too in my tent and at my ship have spoils takenfrom the trojans, but they are not at hand. i have been at all timesvalorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my ownamong the foremost. there may be those among the achaeans who do notknow how i fight, but you know it well enough yourself.\"idomeneus answered, \"i know you for a brave man: you need not tell me.if the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush--andthere is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; it comesout then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change colourat every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps shifting hisweight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart beats fast ashe thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of his teeth;whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be frightened onfinding himself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go intoaction--if the best men were being chosen for such a service, no onecould make light of your courage nor feats of arms. if you were struckby a dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, inyour neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or bellyas you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. but let usno longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill spoken of;go, fetch your spear from the tent at once.\"on this meriones, peer of mars, went to the tent and got himself aspear of bronze. he then followed after idomeneus, big with great deedsof valour. as when baneful mars sallies forth to battle, and his sonpanic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror even intothe heart of a hero--the pair have gone from thrace to arm themselvesamong the ephyri or the brave phlegyans, but they will not listen toboth the contending hosts, and will give victory to one side or to theother--even so did meriones and idomeneus, captains of men, go out tobattle clad in their bronze armour. meriones was first to speak. \"sonof deucalion,\" said he, \"where would you have us begin fighting? on theright wing of the host, in the centre, or on the left wing, where itake it the achaeans will be weakest?\"idomeneus answered, \"there are others to defend the centre--the twoajaxes and teucer, who is the finest archer of all the achaeans, and isgood also in a hand-to-hand fight. these will give hector son of priamenough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish theirindomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of saturn fling afirebrand upon them with his own hand. great ajax son of telamon willyield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the grain of ceres, ifbronze and great stones can overthrow him. he would not yield even toachilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is noneto beat him; let us turn therefore towards the left wing, that we mayknow forthwith whether we are to give glory to some other, or he to us.\"meriones, peer of fleet mars, then led the way till they came to thepart of the host which idomeneus had named.now when the trojans saw idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire, himand his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted andmade towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight ragedunder the ships' sterns. fierce as the shrill winds that whistle upon aday when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it into athick cloud--even such was the fury of the combat, and might and maindid they hack at each other with spear and sword throughout the host.the field bristled with the long and deadly spears which they bore.dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their fresh-burnishedbreastplates, and glittering shields as they joined battle with oneanother. iron indeed must be his courage who could take pleasure in thesight of such a turmoil, and look on it without being dismayed.thus did the two mighty sons of saturn devise evil for mortal heroes.jove was minded to give victory to the trojans and to hector, so as todo honour to fleet achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterlyoverthrow the achaean host before ilius, and only wanted to glorifythetis and her valiant son. neptune on the other hand went about amongthe argives to incite them, having come up from the grey sea in secret,for he was grieved at seeing them vanquished by the trojans, and wasfuriously angry with jove. both were of the same race and country, butjove was elder born and knew more, therefore neptune feared to defendthe argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on encouragingthem throughout their host. thus, then, did these two devise a knot ofwar and battle, that none could unloose or break, and set both sidestugging at it, to the failing of men's knees beneath them.and now idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,called loud on the danaans and spread panic among the trojans as heleaped in among them. he slew othryoneus from cabesus, a sojourner, whohad but lately come to take part in the war. he sought cassandra, thefairest of priam's daughters, in marriage, but offered no gifts ofwooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would drive thesons of the achaeans willy nilly from troy; old king priam had givenhis consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on the strengthof the promises thus made to him. idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit himas he came striding on. his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, andthe spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily to the ground.then idomeneus vaunted over him saying, \"othryoneus, there is no one inthe world whom i shall admire more than i do you, if you indeed performwhat you have promised priam son of dardanus in return for hisdaughter. we too will make you an offer; we will give you the loveliestdaughter of the son of atreus, and will bring her from argos for you tomarry, if you will sack the goodly city of ilius in company withourselves; so come along with me, that we may make a covenant at theships about the marriage, and we will not be hard upon you about giftsof wooing.\"with this idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick ofthe fight, but asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in front ofhis horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he couldfeel their breath upon his shoulder. he was longing to strike downidomeneus, but ere he could do so idomeneus smote him with his spear inthe throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean through it.he fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights have felled forship's timber upon the mountains with whetted axes--even thus did helie full length in front of his chariot and horses, grinding his teethand clutching at the bloodstained dust. his charioteer was struck withpanic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape: thereuponantilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a spear; his cuirassof bronze did not protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly. hefell gasping from his chariot and antilochus, great nestor's son, drovehis horses from the trojans to the achaeans.deiphobus then came close up to idomeneus to avenge asius, and took aimat him with a spear, but idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided it,for he was covered by the round shield he always bore--a shield ofoxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. he crouched undercover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield rang out asthe spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the stronghand of deiphobus, for it struck hypsenor son of hippasus, shepherd ofhis people, in the liver under the midriff, and his limbs failedbeneath him. deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voicesaying, \"of a truth asius has not fallen unavenged; he will be gladeven while passing into the house of hades, strong warden of the gate,that i have sent some one to escort him.\"thus did he vaunt, and the argives were stung by his saying. nobleantilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make himforget his friend and comrade. he ran up to him, bestrode him, andcovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades,mecisteus son of echius, and alastor, stooped down, and bore him awaygroaning heavily to the ships. but idomeneus ceased not his fury. hekept on striving continually either to enshroud some trojan in thedarkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil dayfrom the achaeans. then fell alcathous son of noble aesyetes; he wasson-in-law to anchises, having married his eldest daughter hippodameia,who was the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all hergeneration in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore thebravest man in all troy had taken her to wife--him did neptune lay lowby the hand of idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding hisstrong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to oneside, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when idomeneusstruck him with a spear in the middle of his chest. the coat of mailthat had hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang harshlyas the spear tore through it. he fell heavily to the ground, and thespear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end ofthe spear quiver till dread mars put an end to his life. idomeneusvaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, \"deiphobus, sinceyou are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killedthree men to your one? nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself, thatyou may learn what manner of jove-begotten man am i that have comehither. jove first begot minos, chief ruler in crete, and minos in histurn begot a son, noble deucalion. deucalion begot me to be a rulerover many men in crete, and my ships have now brought me hither, to bethe bane of yourself, your father, and the trojans.\"thus did he speak, and deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go backand fetch some other trojan to help him, or to take up the challengesingle-handed. in the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch aeneas,whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved withpriam because in spite of his brave deeds he did not give him his dueshare of honour. deiphobus went up to him and said, \"aeneas, princeamong the trojans, if you know any ties of kinship, help me now todefend the body of your sister's husband; come with me to the rescue ofalcathous, who being husband to your sister brought you up when youwere a child in his house, and now idomeneus has slain him.\"with these words he moved the heart of aeneas, and he went in pursuitof idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but idomeneus was not tobe thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his ground as awild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of a greatcrowd of men in some lonely place--the bristles stand upright on hisback, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness todefend himself against hounds and men--even so did famed idomeneus holdhis ground and budge not at the coming of aeneas. he cried aloud to hiscomrades looking towards ascalaphus, aphareus, deipyrus, meriones, andantilochus, all of them brave soldiers--\"hither my friends,\" he cried,\"and leave me not single-handed--i go in great fear by fleet aeneas,who is coming against me, and is a redoubtable dispenser of deathbattle. moreover he is in the flower of youth when a man's strength isgreatest; if i was of the same age as he is and in my present mind,either he or i should soon bear away the prize of victory.\"on this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder.aeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking towardsdeiphobus, paris, and agenor, who were leaders of the trojans alongwith himself, and the people followed them as sheep follow the ram whenthey go down to drink after they have been feeding, and the heart ofthe shepherd is glad--even so was the heart of aeneas gladdened when hesaw his people follow him.then they fought furiously in close combat about the body of alcathous,wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about their bodiesrang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press of thefight, while the two heroes aeneas and idomeneus, peers of mars,outvied everyone in their desire to hack at each other with sword andspear. aeneas took aim first, but idomeneus was on the lookout andavoided the spear, so that it sped from aeneas' strong hand in vain,and fell quivering in the ground. idomeneus meanwhile smote oenomaus inthe middle of his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereonhis bowels came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms ofhis hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. idomeneus drew his spearout of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his armour forthe rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strengthwas now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge, andcould neither spring forward to recover his own weapon nor swerve asideto avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still defendedhimself in hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear himswiftly out of the battle. deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he wasretreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him was asfierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit ascalaphus, the son ofmars; the spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth inthe palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.grim mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen, forhe was sitting on the summits of olympus under the golden clouds, bycommand of jove, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden totake part in the battle. meanwhile men fought furiously about the body.deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but meriones sprang uponhim, and struck him on the arm with a spear so that the visored helmetfell from his hand and came ringing down upon the ground. thereonmeriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from hisshoulder, and fell back under cover of his men. then polites, ownbrother of deiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore himaway from the battle till he got to his horses that were standing inthe rear of the fight with the chariot and their driver. these took himtowards the city groaning and in great pain, with the blood flowingfrom his arm.the others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven withoutceasing. aeneas sprang on aphareus son of caletor, and struck him witha spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head fell onone side, his helmet and shield came down along with him, and death,life's foe, was shed around him. antilochus spied his chance, flewforward towards thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round. he laidopen the vein that runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cutthis vein clean away throughout its whole course, and thoon fell in thedust face upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly towards hiscomrades. antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the armour from hisshoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. the trojans cameabout him on every side and struck his broad and gleaming shield, butcould not wound his body, for neptune stood guard over the son ofnestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. he was never clear ofthe foe, but was always in the thick of the fight; his spear was neveridle; he poised and aimed it in every direction, so eager was he to hitsomeone from a distance or to fight him hand to hand.as he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by adamas, son ofasius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the middleof his shield, but neptune made its point without effect, for hegrudged him the life of antilochus. one half, therefore, of the spearstuck fast like a charred stake in antilochus's shield, while the otherlay on the ground. adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men,but meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway between theprivate parts and the navel, where a wound is particularly painful towretched mortals. there did meriones transfix him, and he writhedconvulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen havebound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce. even so did hemove convulsively for a while, but not for very long, till merionescame up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes were veiled indarkness.helenus then struck deipyrus with a great thracian sword, hitting himon the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his head; thehelmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were fighting on theachaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but the eyesof deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.on this menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards helenus,brandishing his spear; but helenus drew his bow, and the two attackedone another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and theother with his bow and arrow. the son of priam hit the breastplate ofmenelaus's corslet, but the arrow glanced from off it. as black beansor pulse come pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the broadwinnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel--evenso did the arrow glance off and recoil from the shield of menelaus, whoin his turn wounded the hand with which helenus carried his bow; thespear went right through his hand and stuck in the bow itself, so thatto his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand draggingby his side--for the spear weighed it down till agenor drew it out andbound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which his esquire hadwith him.pisander then made straight at menelaus--his evil destiny luring him onto his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, o menelaus. when thetwo were hard by one another the spear of the son of atreus turnedaside and he missed his aim; pisander then struck the shield of bravemenelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the spear andbroke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure of victory;forthwith, however, the son of atreus drew his sword and sprang uponhim. pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with its long andpolished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under his shield,and the two made at one another. pisander struck the peak of menelaus'scrested helmet just under the crest itself, and menelaus hit pisanderas he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of hisnose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell by hisfeet in the dust. he fell backwards to the ground, and menelaus set hisheel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and vaunted over him saying,\"even thus shall you trojans leave the ships of the achaeans, proud andinsatiate of battle though you be, nor shall you lack any of thedisgrace and shame which you have heaped upon myself. cowardlyshe-wolves that you are, you feared not the anger of dread jove,avenger of violated hospitality, who will one day destroy your city;you stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure whenyou were her guest, and now you would fling fire upon our ships, andkill our heroes. a day will come when, rage as you may, you shall bestayed. o father jove, you, who they say art above all, both gods andmen, in wisdom, and from whom all things that befall us do proceed, howcan you thus favour the trojans--men so proud and overweening, thatthey are never tired of fighting? all things pall after a while--sleep,love, sweet song, and stately dance--still these are things of which aman would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is ofbattle that the trojans are insatiate.\"so saying menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body ofpisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himselfamong those who were in the front of the fight.harpalion son of king pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come tofight at troy along with his father, but he did not go home again. hestruck the middle of menelaus's shield with his spear but could notpierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his men,looking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. but merionesaimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and hithim on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through andthrough, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was andbreathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a wormupon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed fromhis wound. the brave paphlagonians tended him with all due care; theyraised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city oftroy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there was noransom that could bring his dead son to life again.paris was deeply grieved by the death of harpalion, who was his hostwhen he went among the paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, inorder to avenge him. now there was a certain man named euchenor, son ofpolyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was incorinth. this euchenor had set sail for troy well knowing that it wouldbe the death of him, for his good old father polyidus had often toldhim that he must either stay at home and die of a terrible disease, orgo with the achaeans and perish at the hands of the trojans; he chose,therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the achaeans would havelaid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain and suffering ofdisease. paris now smote him on the jaw under his ear, whereon the lifewent out of him and he was enshrouded in the darkness of death.thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. but hector had notyet heard, and did not know that the argives were making havoc of hismen on the left wing of the battle, where the achaeans ere long wouldhave triumphed over them, so vigorously did neptune cheer them on andhelp them. he therefore held on at the point where he had first forcedhis way through the gates and the wall, after breaking through theserried ranks of danaan warriors. it was here that the ships of ajaxand protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here the wall was atits lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely.the boeotians and the ionians with their long tunics, the locrians, themen of phthia, and the famous force of the epeans could hardly stayhector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could they drive him fromthem, for he was as a wall of fire. the chosen men of the athenianswere in the van, led by menestheus son of peteos, with whom were alsopheidas, stichius, and stalwart bias; meges son of phyleus, amphion,and dracius commanded the epeans, while medon and staunch podarces ledthe men of phthia. of these, medon was bastard son to oileus andbrother of ajax, but he lived in phylace away from his own country, forhe had killed the brother of his stepmother eriopis, the wife ofoileus; the other, podarces, was the son of iphiclus, son of phylacus.these two stood in the van of the phthians, and defended the shipsalong with the boeotians.ajax son of oileus, never for a moment left the side of ajax, son oftelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the ploughwhich they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat steams upwardsfrom about the roots of their horns--nothing but the yoke divides themas they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field--evenso did the two ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another. manyand brave comrades followed the son of telamon, to relieve him of hisshield when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the locrians didnot follow so close after the son of oileus, for they could not holdtheir own in a hand-to-hand fight. they had no bronze helmets withplumes of horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears, butthey had come to troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted woolfrom which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of thetrojans. the others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the bruntof the fight with the trojans and with hector, while the locrians shotfrom behind, under their cover; and thus the trojans began to loseheart, for the arrows threw them into confusion.the trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the shipsand tents back to windy ilius, had not polydamas presently said tohector, \"hector, there is no persuading you to take advice. becauseheaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you think thatyou must therefore excel others in counsel; but you cannot thus claimpreeminence in all things. heaven has made one man an excellentsoldier; of another it has made a dancer or a singer and player on thelyre; while yet in another jove has implanted a wise understanding ofwhich men reap fruit to the saving of many, and he himself knows moreabout it than any one; therefore i will say what i think will be best.the fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now thatthe trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in fullarmour, while others are fighting scattered and outnumbered near theships. draw back, therefore, and call your chieftains round you, thatwe may advise together whether to fall now upon the ships in the hopethat heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to beat a retreat while we canyet safely do so. i greatly fear that the achaeans will pay us theirdebt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at their ships whois never weary of battle, and who will not hold aloof much longer.\"thus spoke polydamas, and his words pleased hector well. he sprang infull armour from his chariot and said, \"polydamas, gather thechieftains here; i will go yonder into the fight, but will return atonce when i have given them their orders.\"he then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loudcry flew through the ranks of the trojans and their allies. when theyheard his voice they all hastened to gather round polydamas, theexcellent son of panthous, but hector kept on among the foremost,looking everywhere to find deiphobus and prince helenus, adamas son ofasius, and asius son of hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless hecould no longer find them, for the two last were lying by the sterns ofthe achaean ships, slain by the argives, while the others had been alsostricken and wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dreadbattle he found alexandrus, husband of lovely helen, cheering his menand urging them on to fight. he went up to him and upbraided him.\"paris,\" said he, \"evil-hearted paris, fair to see but woman-mad andfalse of tongue, where are deiphobus and king helenus? where are adamasson of asius, and asius son of hyrtacus? where too is othryoneus? iliusis undone and will now surely fall!\"alexandrus answered, \"hector, why find fault when there is no one tofind fault with? i should hold aloof from battle on any day rather thanthis, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about me. fromthe moment when you set our men fighting about the ships we have beenstaying here and doing battle with the danaans. our comrades about whomyou ask me are dead; deiphobus and king helenus alone have left thefield, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son of saturn savedthem alive. now, therefore, lead on where you would have us go, and wewill follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us fail you in sofar as our strength holds out, but no man can do more than in him lies,no matter how willing he may be.\"with these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards thepart of the battle where the fight was thickest, about cebriones, bravepolydamas, phalces, orthaeus, godlike polyphetes, palmys, ascanius, andmorys son of hippotion, who had come from fertile ascania on thepreceding day to relieve other troops. then jove urged them on tofight. they flew forth like the blasts of some fierce wind that strikeearth in the van of a thunderstorm--they buffet the salt sea into anuproar; many and mighty are the great waves that come crashing in oneafter the other upon the shore with their arching heads all crestedwith foam--even so did rank behind rank of trojans arrayed in gleamingarmour follow their leaders onward. the way was led by hector son ofpriam, peer of murderous mars, with his round shield before him--hisshield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze--and his gleaminghelmet upon his temples. he kept stepping forward under cover of hisshield in every direction, making trial of the ranks to see if theywould give way before him, but he could not daunt the courage of theachaeans. ajax was the first to stride out and challenge him. \"sir,\" hecried, \"draw near; why do you think thus vainly to dismay the argives?we achaeans are excellent soldiers, but the scourge of jove has fallenheavily upon us. your heart, forsooth, is set on destroying our ships,but we too have hands that can keep you at bay, and your own fair townshall be sooner taken and sacked by ourselves. the time is near whenyou shall pray jove and all the gods in your flight, that your steedsmay be swifter than hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bearyou back to your city.\"as he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and thehost of the achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. buthector answered, \"ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that i wereas sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing jove, with queenjuno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with minerva andapollo, as i am that this day is big with the destruction of theachaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dare abide my spear; itshall rend your fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds of preywith your fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of the achaeans.\"with these words he led the way and the others followed after with acry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. the argiveson their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget theirprowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the trojan chieftains,and the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the brightnessof jove's presence.book xiv  agamemnon proposes that the achaeans should sail home, and  is rebuked by ulysses--juno beguiles jupiter--hector is  wounded.nestor was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escapehim, and he said to the son of aesculapius, \"what, noble machaon, isthe meaning of all this? the shouts of men fighting by our ships growstronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your wine,while fair hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted blood fromoff you. i will go at once to the look-out station and see what it isall about.\"as he spoke he took up the shield of his son thrasymedes that was lyingin his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for thrasymedes had taken hisfather's shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and assoon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the achaeans who, nowthat their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before thetrojans. as when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves aredumb--they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence thefierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and setneither this way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down fromheaven to determine them--even so did the old man ponder whether tomake for the crowd of danaans, or go in search of agamemnon. in the endhe deemed it best to go to the son of atreus; but meanwhile the hostswere fighting and killing one another, and the hard bronze rattled ontheir bodies, as they thrust at one another with their swords andspears.the wounded kings, the son of tydeus, ulysses, and agamemnon son ofatreus, fell in with nestor as they were coming up from theirships--for theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting wasgoing on, being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beachedfirst, while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. the stretchof the shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all theships, and the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placedthe ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the wholeopening of the bay between the two points that formed it. the kings,leaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being ingreat anxiety, and when old nestor met them they were filled withdismay. then king agamemnon said to him, \"nestor son of neleus, honourto the achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? ifear that what dread hector said will come true, when he vaunted amongthe trojans saying that he would not return to ilius till he had firedour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all comingtrue. alas! others of the achaeans, like achilles, are in such anger withme that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.\"then nestor knight of gerene, answered, \"it is indeed as you say; it isall coming true at this moment, and even jove who thunders from on highcannot prevent it. fallen is the wall on which we relied as animpregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. the trojans are fightingstubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you may youcannot see from what quarter the rout of the achaeans is coming; theyare being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends toheaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had betterdo; but i do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for a mancannot fight when he is wounded.\"and king agamemnon answered, \"nestor, if the trojans are indeedfighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trenchhas served us--over which the danaans toiled so hard, and which theydeemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet--i seeit must be the will of jove that the achaeans should perishingloriously here, far from argos. i knew when jove was willing todefend us, and i know now that he is raising the trojans to like honourwith the gods, while us, on the other hand, he has bound hand and foot.now, therefore, let us all do as i say; let us bring down the shipsthat are on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make themfast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall ofnight--if even by night the trojans will desist from fighting; we maythen draw down the rest of the fleet. there is nothing wrong in flyingruin even by night. it is better for a man that he should fly and besaved than be caught and killed.\"ulysses looked fiercely at him and said, \"son of atreus, what are youtalking about? wretch, you should have commanded some other and baserarmy, and not been ruler over us to whom jove has allotted a life ofhard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of us perish. isit thus that you would quit the city of troy, to win which we havesuffered so much hardship? hold your peace, lest some other of theachaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give good counsel,no king over so great a host as that of the argives should ever havelet fall from his lips. i despise your judgement utterly for what youhave been saying. would you, then, have us draw down our ships into thewater while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the handsof the conquering trojans? it would be ruin; the achaeans will not goon fighting when they see the ships being drawn into the water, butwill cease attacking and keep turning their eyes towards them; yourcounsel, therefore, sir captain, would be our destruction.\"agamemnon answered, \"ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart. iam not, however, ordering the achaeans to draw their ships into the seawhether they will or no. someone, it may be, old or young, can offer usbetter counsel which i shall rejoice to hear.\"then said diomed, \"such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, ifyou will listen to me and not resent my speaking though i am youngerthan any of you. i am by lineage son to a noble sire, tydeus, who liesburied at thebes. for portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,agrius and melas, abode in pleuron and rocky calydon. the third was theknight oeneus, my father's father, and he was the most valiant of themall. oeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as jove and theother gods ordained it) migrated to argos. he married into the familyof adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance, for he had largeestates of rich corn-growing land, with much orchard ground as well,and he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the argives in the useof the spear. you must yourselves have heard whether these things aretrue or no; therefore when i say well despise not my words as though iwere a coward or of ignoble birth. i say, then, let us go to the fightas we needs must, wounded though we be. when there, we may keep out ofthe battle and beyond the range of the spears lest we get fresh woundsin addition to what we have already, but we can spur on others, whohave been indulging their spleen and holding aloof from battlehitherto.\"thus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,king agamemnon leading the way.meanwhile neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them inthe semblance of an old man. he took agamemnon's right hand in his ownand said, \"son of atreus, i take it achilles is glad now that he seesthe achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse--mayhe come to a bad end and heaven confound him. as for yourself, theblessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that theprinces and counsellors of the trojans shall again raise the dust uponthe plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tentstowards their city.\"with this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to theplain. the voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine orten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight, and itput fresh courage into the hearts of the achaeans to wage war and dobattle without ceasing.juno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak ofolympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at onceher brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither amidthe fighting. then she turned her eyes to jove as he sat on the topmostcrests of many-fountained ida, and loathed him. she set herself tothink how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that itwould be best for her to go to ida and array herself in rich attire, inthe hope that jove might become enamoured of her, and wish to embraceher. while he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be madeto steal over his eyes and senses.she went, therefore, to the room which her son vulcan had made her, andthe doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret keyso that no other god could open them. here she entered and closed thedoors behind her. she cleansed all the dirt from her fair body withambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambrosial, verysoft, and scented specially for herself--if it were so much as shakenin the bronze-floored house of jove, the scent pervaded the universe ofheaven and earth. with this she anointed her delicate skin, and thenshe plaited the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in a stream of goldentresses from her immortal head. she put on the wondrous robe whichminerva had worked for her with consummate art, and had embroideredwith manifold devices; she fastened it about her bosom with goldenclasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that had a hundredtassels: then she fastened her earrings, three brilliant pendants thatglistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes of her ears, andthrew a lovely new veil over her head. she bound her sandals on to herfeet, and when she had arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction,she left her room and called venus to come aside and speak to her. \"mydear child,\" said she, \"will you do what i am going to ask of you, orwill you refuse me because you are angry at my being on the danaanside, while you are on the trojan?\"jove's daughter venus answered, \"juno, august queen of goddesses,daughter of mighty saturn, say what you want, and i will do it for youat once, if i can, and if it can be done at all.\"then juno told her a lying tale and said, \"i want you to endow me withsome of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all thingsmortal and immortal to your feet. i am going to the world's end tovisit oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother tethys: theyreceived me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up, havingtaken me over from rhaea when jove imprisoned great saturn in thedepths that are under earth and sea. i must go and see them that i maymake peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are so angrythat they have not slept with one another this long while; if i canbring them round and restore them to one another's embraces, they willbe grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.\"thereon laughter-loving venus said, \"i cannot and must not refuse you,for you sleep in the arms of jove who is our king.\"as she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered girdleinto which all her charms had been wrought--love, desire, and thatsweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent. shegave the girdle to juno and said, \"take this girdle wherein all mycharms reside and lay it in your bosom. if you will wear it i promiseyou that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless.\"when she heard this juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdlein her bosom.venus now went back into the house of jove, while juno darted down fromthe summits of olympus. she passed over pieria and fair emathia, andwent on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the thracianhorsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting footto ground. when she came to athos she went on over the waves of the seatill she reached lemnos, the city of noble thoas. there she met sleep,own brother to death, and caught him by the hand, saying, \"sleep, youwho lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if you ever did me aservice in times past, do one for me now, and i shall be grateful toyou ever after. close jove's keen eyes for me in slumber while i holdhim clasped in my embrace, and i will give you a beautiful golden seat,that can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son vulcan shall make itfor you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to rest your fairfeet upon when you are at table.\"then sleep answered, \"juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter ofmighty saturn, i would lull any other of the gods to sleep withoutcompunction, not even excepting the waters of oceanus from whom all ofthem proceed, but i dare not go near jove, nor send him to sleep unlesshe bids me. i have had one lesson already through doing what you askedme, on the day when jove's mighty son hercules set sail from iliusafter having sacked the city of the trojans. at your bidding i suffusedmy sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing jove, and laid him torest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against hercules, and set the blastsof the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him to thegoodly city of cos, away from all his friends. jove was furious when heawoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the house; he waslooking more particularly for myself, and would have flung me downthrough space into the sea where i should never have been heard of anymore, had not night who cows both men and gods protected me. i fled toher and jove left off looking for me in spite of his being so angry,for he did not dare do anything to displease night. and now you areagain asking me to do something on which i cannot venture.\"and juno said, \"sleep, why do you take such notions as those into yourhead? do you think jove will be as anxious to help the trojans, as hewas about his own son? come, i will marry you to one of the youngest ofthe graces, and she shall be your own--pasithea, whom you have alwayswanted to marry.\"sleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, \"then swear it tome by the dread waters of the river styx; lay one hand on the bounteousearth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods whodwell down below with saturn may be our witnesses, and see that youreally do give me one of the youngest of the graces--pasithea, whom ihave always wanted to marry.\"juno did as he had said. she swore, and invoked all the gods of thenether world, who are called titans, to witness. when she had completedher oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and spedlightly forward, leaving lemnos and imbrus behind them. presently theyreached many-fountained ida, mother of wild beasts, and lectum wherethey left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of theforest soughed under the going of their feet. here sleep halted, andere jove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree--the tallestthat reared its head towards heaven on all ida. he hid himself behindthe branches and sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing birdthat haunts the mountains and is called chalcis by the gods, but mencall it cymindis. juno then went to gargarus, the topmost peak of ida,and jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. as soon as he did sohe became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her that he hadfelt when they had first enjoyed each other's embraces, and slept withone another without their dear parents knowing anything about it. hewent up to her and said, \"what do you want that you have come hitherfrom olympus--and that too with neither chariot nor horses to conveyyou?\"then juno told him a lying tale and said, \"i am going to the world'send, to visit oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mothertethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, and broughtme up. i must go and see them that i may make peace between them: theyhave been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not slept withone another this long time. the horses that will take me over land andsea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained ida, and ihave come here from olympus on purpose to consult you. i was afraid youmight be angry with me later on, if i went to the house of oceanuswithout letting you know.\"and jove said, \"juno, you can choose some other time for paying yourvisit to oceanus--for the present let us devote ourselves to love andto the enjoyment of one another. never yet have i been so overpoweredby passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as i am at this momentfor yourself--not even when i was in love with the wife of ixion whobore me pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with danae thedaintily-ancled daughter of acrisius, who bore me the famed heroperseus. then there was the daughter of phoenix, who bore me minos andrhadamanthus: there was semele, and alcmena in thebes by whom i begotmy lion-hearted son hercules, while semele became mother to bacchus thecomforter of mankind. there was queen ceres again, and lovely leto, andyourself--but with none of these was i ever so much enamoured as i nowam with you.\"juno again answered him with a lying tale. \"most dread son of saturn,\"she exclaimed, \"what are you talking about? would you have us enjoy oneanother here on the top of mount ida, where everything can be seen?what if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together,and tell the others? it would be such a scandal that when i had risenfrom your embraces i could never show myself inside your house again;but if you are so minded, there is a room which your son vulcan hasmade me, and he has given it good strong doors; if you would so haveit, let us go thither and lie down.\"and jove answered, \"juno, you need not be afraid that either god or manwill see you, for i will enshroud both of us in such a dense goldencloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall notsee through it.\"with this the son of saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon theearth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangledlotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them wellabove the ground. here they laid themselves down and overhead they werecovered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell glitteringdew-drops.thus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the crestof ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse inhis arms. meanwhile sleep made off to the ships of the achaeans, totell earth-encircling neptune, lord of the earthquake. when he hadfound him he said, \"now, neptune, you can help the danaans with a will,and give them victory though it be only for a short time while jove isstill sleeping. i have sent him into a sweet slumber, and juno hasbeguiled him into going to bed with her.\"sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, leavingneptune more eager than ever to help the danaans. he darted forwardamong the first ranks and shouted saying, \"argives, shall we let hectorson of priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himselfwith glory? this is what he says that he shall now do, seeing thatachilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; we shall get on very wellwithout him if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another.now, therefore, let us all do as i say. let us each take the best andlargest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally forthwith our longest spears in our hands; i will lead you on, and hectorson of priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against us. ifany good staunch soldier has only a small shield, let him hand it overto a worse man, and take a larger one for himself.\"thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. the son of tydeus,ulysses, and agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others inarray, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour; themost valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse man.when they had donned their bronze armour they marched on with neptuneat their head. in his strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keenof edge and flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it inthe day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from it.hector on the other side set the trojans in array. thereon neptune andhector waged fierce war on one another--hector on the trojan andneptune on the argive side. mighty was the uproar as the two forcesmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of theachaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when drivenbefore the blast of boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roarmore fiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor does thewind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through the tops of when itis blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout which the trojans andachaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.hector first aimed his spear at ajax, who was turned full towards him,nor did he miss his aim. the spear struck him where two bands passedover his chest--the band of his shield and that of his silver-studdedsword--and these protected his body. hector was angry that his spearshould have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his men.as he was thus retreating, ajax son of telamon, struck him with astone, of which there were many lying about under the men's feet asthey fought--brought there to give support to the ships' sides as theylay on the shore. ajax caught up one of them and struck hector abovethe rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin roundlike a top and reel in all directions. as an oak falls headlong whenuprooted by the lightning flash of father jove, and there is a terriblesmell of brimstone--no man can help being dismayed if he is standingnear it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing--even so did hectorfall to earth and bite the dust. his spear fell from his hand, but hisshield and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze armourrang about him.the sons of the achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the trojans,but none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and coveredby the princes polydamas, aeneas, agenor, sarpedon captain of thelycians, and noble glaucus. of the others, too, there was not one whowas unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him tocover him. his comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore himaway from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting forhim at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot; thesethen took him towards the city groaning and in great pain. when theyreached the ford of the fair stream of xanthus, begotten of immortaljove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on theground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathedagain and opened his eyes. then kneeling on his knees he vomited blood,but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again closed indarkness for he was still stunned by the blow.when the argives saw hector leaving the field, they took heart and setupon the trojans yet more furiously. ajax fleet son of oileus began byspringing on satnius son of enops, and wounding him with his spear: afair naiad nymph had borne him to enops as he was herding cattle by thebanks of the river satnioeis. the son of oileus came up to him andstruck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce fight betweentrojans and danaans raged round his body. polydamas son of panthousdrew near to avenge him, and wounded prothoenor son of areilycus on theright shoulder; the terrible spear went right through his shoulder, andhe clutched the earth as he fell in the dust. polydamas vaunted loudlyover him saying, \"again i take it that the spear has not sped in vainfrom the strong hand of the son of panthous; an argive has caught it inhis body, and it will serve him for a staff as he goes down into thehouse of hades.\"the argives were maddened by this boasting. ajax son of telamon wasmore angry than any, for the man had fallen close beside him; so heaimed at polydamas as he was retreating, but polydamas saved himself byswerving aside and the spear struck archelochus son of antenor, forheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head springsfrom the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both thetendons at the back of the head. his head, mouth, and nostrils reachedthe ground long before his legs and knees could do so, and ajax shoutedto polydamas saying, \"think, polydamas, and tell me truly whether thisman is not as well worth killing as prothoenor was: he seems rich, andof rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight antenor, forhe is very like him.\"but he knew well who it was, and the trojans were greatly angered.acamas then bestrode his brother's body and wounded promachus theboeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother's bodyaway. acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \"argive archers, braggartsthat you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only, but some ofyou too shall fall here as well as ourselves. see how promachus nowsleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother's blood has notbeen long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leavesa kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.\"his taunts infuriated the argives, and peneleos was more enraged thanany of them. he sprang towards acamas, but acamas did not stand hisground, and he killed ilioneus son of the rich flock-master phorbas,whom mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than anyother of the trojans. ilioneus was his only son, and peneleos nowwounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball fromits socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of theneck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. peneleos thendrew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmetcame tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in theeye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head, andshowed it to the trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. \"trojans,\"he cried, \"bid the father and mother of noble ilioneus make moan forhim in their house, for the wife also of promachus son of alegenor willnever be gladdened by the coming of her dear husband--when we argivesreturn with our ships from troy.\"as he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about tosee whither he might fly for safety.tell me now, o muses that dwell on olympus, who was the first of theargives to bear away blood-stained spoils after neptune lord of theearthquake had turned the fortune of war. ajax son of telamon was firstto wound hyrtius son of gyrtius, captain of the staunch mysians.antilochus killed phalces and mermerus, while meriones slew morys andhippotion, teucer also killed prothoon and periphetes. the son ofatreus then wounded hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank, andthe bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among them;on this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where he hadbeen wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. ajax son of oileuskilled more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he topursue flying foes when jove had spread panic among them.book xv  jove awakes, tells apollo to heal hector, and the trojans  again become victorious.but when their flight had taken them past the trench and the setstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the danaans, the trojansmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear. jovenow woke on the crests of ida, where he was lying with golden-thronedjuno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the trojans andachaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others driving thempell-mell before them with king neptune in their midst. he saw hectorlying on the ground with his comrades gathered round him, gasping forbreath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, for it was not thefeeblest of the achaeans who struck him.the sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on juno.\"i see, juno,\" said he, \"you mischief-making trickster, that yourcunning has stayed hector from fighting and has caused the rout of hishost. i am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will be thefirst to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. do you not rememberhow once upon a time i had you hanged? i fastened two anvils on to yourfeet, and bound your hands in a chain of gold which none might break,and you hung in mid-air among the clouds. all the gods in olympus werein a fury, but they could not reach you to set you free; when i caughtany one of them i gripped him and hurled him from the heavenlythreshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even this did notrelieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which i felt about noblehercules whom you and boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond the seas tocos, after suborning the tempests; but i rescued him, andnotwithstanding all his mighty labours i brought him back again toargos. i would remind you of this that you may learn to leave off beingso deceitful, and discover how much you are likely to gain by theembraces out of which you have come here to trick me.\"juno trembled as he spoke, and said, \"may heaven above and earth belowbe my witnesses, with the waters of the river styx--and this is themost solemn oath that a blessed god can take--nay, i swear also by yourown almighty head and by our bridal bed--things over which i couldnever possibly perjure myself--that neptune is not punishing hector andthe trojans and helping the achaeans through any doing of mine; it isall of his own mere motion because he was sorry to see the achaeanshard pressed at their ships: if i were advising him, i should tell himto do as you bid him.\"the sire of gods and men smiled and answered, \"if you, juno, werealways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, neptune, likeit or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. if,then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among therank and file of the gods, and tell iris and apollo lord of the bow,that i want them--iris, that she may go to the achaean host and tellneptune to leave off fighting and go home, and apollo, that he may sendhector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he will thusforget his present sufferings, and drive the achaeans back in confusiontill they fall among the ships of achilles son of peleus. achilles willthen send his comrade patroclus into battle, and hector will kill himin front of ilius after he has slain many warriors, and among them myown noble son sarpedon. achilles will kill hector to avenge patroclus,and from that time i will bring it about that the achaeans shallpersistently drive the trojans back till they fulfil the counsels ofminerva and take ilius. but i will not stay my anger, nor permit anygod to help the danaans till i have accomplished the desire of the sonof peleus, according to the promise i made by bowing my head on the daywhen thetis touched my knees and besought me to give him honour.\"juno heeded his words and went from the heights of ida to greatolympus. swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vastcontinents, and he says to himself, \"now i will be here, or there,\" andhe would have all manner of things--even so swiftly did juno wing herway till she came to high olympus and went in among the gods who weregathered in the house of jove. when they saw her they all of them cameup to her, and held out their cups to her by way of greeting. she letthe others be, but took the cup offered her by lovely themis, who wasfirst to come running up to her. \"juno,\" said she, \"why are you here?and you seem troubled--has your husband the son of saturn beenfrightening you?\"and juno answered, \"themis, do not ask me about it. you know what aproud and cruel disposition my husband has. lead the gods to table,where you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which hehas avowed. many a one, mortal and immortal, will be angered by them,however peaceably he may be feasting now.\"on this juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the houseof jove. laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with care,and she spoke up in a rage. \"fools that we are,\" she cried, \"to be thusmadly angry with jove; we keep on wanting to go up to him and stay himby force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares for nobody, forhe knows that he is much stronger than any other of the immortals. makethe best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose to send each one ofyou; mars, i take it, has had a taste of them already, for his sonascalaphus has fallen in battle--the man whom of all others he lovedmost dearly and whose father he owns himself to be.\"when he heard this mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat ofhis hands, and said in anger, \"do not blame me, you gods that dwell inheaven, if i go to the ships of the achaeans and avenge the death of myson, even though it end in my being struck by jove's lightning andlying in blood and dust among the corpses.\"as he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses panic and rout, while heput on his armour. on this, jove would have been roused to still morefierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals, had notminerva, alarmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat andhurried outside. she tore the helmet from his head and the shield fromhis shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his strong hand andset it on one side; then she said to mars, \"madman, you are undone; youhave ears that hear not, or you have lost all judgement andunderstanding; have you not heard what juno has said on coming straightfrom the presence of olympian jove? do you wish to go through all kindsof suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to olympus,after having caused infinite mischief to all us others? jove wouldinstantly leave the trojans and achaeans to themselves; he would cometo olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one after another, guiltyor not guilty. therefore lay aside your anger for the death of yourson; better men than he have either been killed already or will fallhereafter, and one cannot protect every one's whole family.\"with these words she took mars back to his seat. meanwhile juno calledapollo outside, with iris the messenger of the gods. \"jove,\" she saidto them, \"desires you to go to him at once on mt. ida; when you haveseen him you are to do as he may then bid you.\"thereon juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while iris andapollo made all haste on their way. when they reached many-fountainedida, mother of wild beasts, they found jove seated on topmost gargaruswith a fragrant cloud encircling his head as with a diadem. they stoodbefore his presence, and he was pleased with them for having been soquick in obeying the orders his wife had given them.he spoke to iris first. \"go,\" said he, \"fleet iris, tell king neptunewhat i now bid you--and tell him true. bid him leave off fighting, andeither join the company of the gods, or go down into the sea. if hetakes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well whether he isstrong enough to hold his own against me if i attack him. i am olderand much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid to set himself up ason a level with myself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe.\"iris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or snowflakesthat fly from out the clouds before the blast of boreas, even so didshe wing her way till she came close up to the great shaker of theearth. then she said, \"i have come, o dark-haired king that holds theworld in his embrace, to bring you a message from jove. he bids youleave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods or go downinto the sea; if, however, you take no heed and disobey him, he says hewill come down here and fight you. he would have you keep out of hisreach, for he is older and much stronger than you are, and yet you arenot afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself, of whom allthe other gods stand in awe.\"neptune was very angry and said, \"great heavens! strong as jove may be,he has said more than he can do if he has threatened violence againstme, who am of like honour with himself. we were three brothers whomrhea bore to saturn--jove, myself, and hades who rules the world below.heaven and earth were divided into three parts, and each of us was tohave an equal share. when we cast lots, it fell to me to have mydwelling in the sea for evermore; hades took the darkness of the realmsunder the earth, while air and sky and clouds were the portion thatfell to jove; but earth and great olympus are the common property ofall. therefore i will not walk as jove would have me. for all hisstrength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented withoutthreatening to lay hands upon me as though i were nobody. let him keephis bragging talk for his own sons and daughters, who must perforceobey him.\"iris fleet as the wind then answered, \"am i really, neptune, to takethis daring and unyielding message to jove, or will you reconsider youranswer? sensible people are open to argument, and you know that theerinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person.\"neptune answered, \"goddess iris, your words have been spoken in season.it is well when a messenger shows so much discretion. nevertheless itcuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke so angrily anotherwho is his own peer, and of like empire with himself. now, however, iwill give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore let me tell you,and i mean what i say--if contrary to the desire of myself, minervadriver of the spoil, juno, mercury, and king vulcan, jove spares steepilius, and will not let the achaeans have the great triumph of sackingit, let him understand that he will incur our implacable resentment.\"neptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely did theachaeans miss him. then jove said to apollo, \"go, dear phoebus, tohector, for neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has now gonedown under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure. had he notdone so those gods who are below with saturn would have come to hear ofthe fight between us. it is better for both of us that he should havecurbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for i should have had muchtrouble with him. take, then, your tasselled aegis, and shake itfuriously, so as to set the achaean heroes in a panic; take, moreover,brave hector, o far-darter, into your own care, and rouse him to deedsof daring, till the achaeans are sent flying back to their ships and tothe hellespont. from that point i will think it well over, how theachaeans may have a respite from their troubles.\"apollo obeyed his father's saying, and left the crests of ida, flyinglike a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. he found hectorno longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he had just cometo himself again. he knew those who were about him, and the sweat andhard breathing had left him from the moment when the will ofaegis-bearing jove had revived him. apollo stood beside him and said,\"hector son of priam, why are you so faint, and why are you here awayfrom the others? has any mishap befallen you?\"hector in a weak voice answered, \"and which, kind sir, of the gods areyou, who now ask me thus? do you not know that ajax struck me on thechest with a stone as i was killing his comrades at the ships of theachaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? i made sure that thisvery day i should breathe my last and go down into the house of hades.\"then king apollo said to him, \"take heart; the son of saturn has sentyou a mighty helper from ida to stand by you and defend you, even me,phoebus apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto notonly of yourself but of your city. now, therefore, order your horsemento drive their chariots to the ships in great multitudes. i will gobefore your horses to smooth the way for them, and will turn theachaeans in flight.\"as he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his people.and as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallopsgloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take hisbath in the river--he tosses his head, and his mane streams over hisshoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed tothe pastures where the mares are feeding--even so hector, when he heardwhat the god said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as fast ashis limbs could take him. as country peasants set their hounds on to ahomed stag or wild goat--he has taken shelter under rock or thicket,and they cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shoutshave roused stands in their path, and they are in no further humour forthe chase--even so the achaeans were still charging on in a body, usingtheir swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they saw hectorgoing about among his men they were afraid, and their hearts fell downinto their feet.then spoke thoas son of andraemon, leader of the aetolians, a man whocould throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. hethen with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: \"what, inheaven's name, do i now see? is it not hector come to life again? everyone made sure he had been killed by ajax son of telamon, but it seemsthat one of the gods has again rescued him. he has killed many of usdanaans already, and i take it will yet do so, for the hand of jovemust be with him or he would never dare show himself so masterful inthe forefront of the battle. now, therefore, let us all do as i say;let us order the main body of our forces to fall back upon the ships,but let those of us who profess to be the flower of the army standfirm, and see whether we cannot hold hector back at the point of ourspears as soon as he comes near us; i conceive that he will then thinkbetter of it before he tries to charge into the press of the danaans.\"thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. those who wereabout ajax and king idomeneus, the followers moreover of teucer,meriones, and meges peer of mars called all their best men about themand sustained the fight against hector and the trojans, but the mainbody fell back upon the ships of the achaeans.the trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with hector striding on attheir head. before him went phoebus apollo shrouded in cloud about hisshoulders. he bore aloft the terrible aegis with its shaggy fringe,which vulcan the smith had given jove to strike terror into the heartsof men. with this in his hand he led on the trojans.the argives held together and stood their ground. the cry of battlerose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the bowstrings.many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies of manya valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway, before they couldtaste of man's fair flesh and glut themselves with blood. so long asphoebus apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking it, theweapons on either side took effect and the people fell, but when heshook it straight in the face of the danaans and raised his mightybattle-cry their hearts fainted within them and they forgot theirformer prowess. as when two wild beasts spring in the dead of night ona herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman is notthere--even so were the danaans struck helpless, for apollo filled themwith panic and gave victory to hector and the trojans.the fight then became more scattered and they killed one another wherethey best could. hector killed stichius and arcesilaus, the one, leaderof the boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of menestheus.aeneas killed medon and iasus. the first was bastard son to oileus, andbrother to ajax, but he lived in phylace away from his own country, forhe had killed a man, a kinsman of his stepmother eriopis whom oileushad married. iasus had become a leader of the athenians, and was son ofsphelus the son of boucolos. polydamas killed mecisteus, and politesechius, in the front of the battle, while agenor slew clonius. parisstruck deiochus from behind in the lower part of the shoulder, as hewas flying among the foremost, and the point of the spear went cleanthrough him.while they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the achaeanswere flying pell-mell to the trench and the set stakes, and were forcedback within their wall. hector then cried out to the trojans, \"forwardto the ships, and let the spoils be. if i see any man keeping back onthe other side the wall away from the ships i will have him killed: hiskinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but dogsshall tear him in pieces in front of our city.\"as he spoke he laid his whip about his horses' shoulders and called tothe trojans throughout their ranks; the trojans shouted with a cry thatrent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his own. phoebusapollo went before, and kicked down the banks of the deep trench intoits middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as broad as the throw ofa spear when a man is trying his strength. the trojan battalions pouredover the bridge, and apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way. hekicked down the wall of the achaeans as easily as a child who playingon the sea-shore has built a house of sand and then kicks it down againand destroys it--even so did you, o apollo, shed toil and trouble uponthe argives, filling them with panic and confusion.thus then were the achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out toone another and raising their hands with loud cries every man toheaven. nestor of gerene, tower of strength to the achaeans, lifted uphis hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more ferventlythan any of them. \"father jove,\" said he, \"if ever any one inwheat-growing argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer andprayed that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed your head tohim in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the trojans totriumph thus over the achaeans.\"all-counselling jove thundered loudly in answer to the prayer of theaged son of neleus. when they heard jove thunder they flung themselvesyet more fiercely on the achaeans. as a wave breaking over the bulwarksof a ship when the sea runs high before a gale--for it is the force ofthe wind that makes the waves so great--even so did the trojans springover the wall with a shout, and drive their chariots onwards. the twosides fought with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-handencounter-the trojans from their chariots, and the achaeans climbing upinto their ships and wielding the long pikes that were lying on thedecks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze.now patroclus, so long as the achaeans and trojans were fighting aboutthe wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships, remained sittingin the tent of good eurypylus, entertaining him with his conversationand spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. when, however, hesaw the trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while theachaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he cried aloud, andsmote his two thighs with the flat of his hands. \"eurypylus,\" said hein his dismay, \"i know you want me badly, but i cannot stay with youany longer, for there is hard fighting going on; a servant shall takecare of you now, for i must make all speed to achilles, and induce himto fight if i can; who knows but with heaven's help i may persuade him.a man does well to listen to the advice of a friend.\"when he had thus spoken he went his way. the achaeans stood firm andresisted the attack of the trojans, yet though these were fewer innumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither couldthe trojans break the achaean ranks and make their way in among thetents and ships. as a carpenter's line gives a true edge to a piece ofship's timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom minerva hasinstructed in all kinds of useful arts--even so level was the issue ofthe fight between the two sides, as they fought some round one and someround another.hector made straight for ajax, and the two fought fiercely about thesame ship. hector could not force ajax back and fire the ship, nor yetcould ajax drive hector from the spot to which heaven had brought him.then ajax struck caletor son of clytius in the chest with a spear as hewas bringing fire towards the ship. he fell heavily to the ground andthe torch dropped from his hand. when hector saw his cousin fallen infront of the ship he shouted to the trojans and lycians saying,\"trojans, lycians, and dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot,but rescue the son of clytius lest the achaeans strip him of his armournow that he has fallen.\"he then aimed a spear at ajax, and missed him, but he hit lycophron afollower of ajax, who came from cythera, but was living with ajaxinasmuch as he had killed a man among the cythereans. hector's spearstruck him on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from theship's prow on to the ground with no life left in him. ajax shook withrage and said to his brother, \"teucer, my good fellow, our trustycomrade the son of mastor has fallen, he came to live with us fromcythera and whom we honoured as much as our own parents. hector hasjust killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow whichphoebus apollo gave you.\"teucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver inhis hands. forthwith he showered his arrows on the trojans, and hitcleitus the son of pisenor, comrade of polydamas the noble son ofpanthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to hishorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,doing good service to hector and the trojans, but evil had now comeupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert it,for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. he fell from hischariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside. kingpolydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up to thehorses; he gave them in charge to astynous son of protiaon, and orderedhim to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. he then went backand took his place in the front ranks.teucer then aimed another arrow at hector, and there would have been nomore fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then andthere: jove, however, who kept watch over hector, had his eyes onteucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring forhim just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on this thearrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands. teucer shook withanger and said to his brother, \"alas, see how heaven thwarts us in allwe do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand,though i strung it this selfsame morning that it might serve me formany an arrow.\"ajax son of telamon answered, \"my good fellow, let your bow and yourarrows be, for jove has made them useless in order to spite thedanaans. take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and bothfight the trojans yourself and urge others to do so. they may besuccessful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find ita hard matter to take the ships.\"teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. he hung a shieldfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set hishelmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacinglyabove it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwithhe was by the side of ajax.when hector saw that teucer's bow was of no more use to him, he shoutedout to the trojans and lycians, \"trojans, lycians, and dardanians goodin close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle here at theships, for i see the weapon of one of their chieftains made useless bythe hand of jove. it is easy to see when jove is helping people andmeans to help them still further, or again when he is bringing themdown and will do nothing for them; he is now on our side, and is goingagainst the argives. therefore swarm round the ships and fight. if anyof you is struck by spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; hedies with honour who dies fighting for his country; and he will leavehis wife and children safe behind him, with his house and allotmentunplundered if only the achaeans can be driven back to their own land,they and their ships.\"with these words he put heart and soul into them all. ajax on the otherside exhorted his comrades saying, \"shame on you argives, we are nowutterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the enemy fromour ships. do you think, if hector takes them, that you will be able toget home by land? can you not hear him cheering on his whole host tofire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they are not at a dancebut in battle? our only course is to fight them with might and main; wehad better chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long andwithout issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than ourselves.\"with these words he put life and soul into them all. hector then killedschedius son of perimedes, leader of the phoceans, and ajax killedlaodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to antenor. polydamas killedotus of cyllene a comrade of the son of phyleus and chief of the proudepeans. when meges saw this he sprang upon him, but polydamas croucheddown, and he missed him, for apollo would not suffer the son ofpanthous to fall in battle; but the spear hit croesmus in the middle ofhis chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and meges strippedhim of his armour. at that moment the valiant soldier dolops son oflampus sprang upon lampus was son of laomedon and noted for his valour,while his son dolops was versed in all the ways of war. he then struckthe middle of the son of phyleus' shield with his spear, setting on himat close quarters, but his good corslet made with plates of metal savedhim; phyleus had brought it from ephyra and the river selleis, wherehis host, king euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protecthim. it now served to save the life of his son. then meges struck thetopmost crest of dolops's bronze helmet with his spear and tore awayits plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet as it wasit tumbled down into the dust. while he was still fighting andconfident of victory, menelaus came up to help meges, and got by theside of dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, frombehind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into hischest, whereon he fell headlong. the two then made towards him to striphim of his armour, but hector called on all his brothers for help, andhe especially upbraided brave melanippus son of hiketaon, who erewhileused to pasture his herds of cattle in percote before the war brokeout; but when the ships of the danaans came, he went back to ilius,where he was eminent among the trojans, and lived near priam whotreated him as one of his own sons. hector now rebuked him and said,\"why, melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note of the deathof your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying to takedolops's armour? follow me; there must be no fighting the argives froma distance now, but we must do so in close combat till either we killthem or they take the high wall of ilius and slay her people.\"he led on as he spoke, and the hero melanippus followed after.meanwhile ajax son of telamon was cheering on the argives. \"myfriends,\" he cried, \"be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves inbattle so as to win respect from one another. men who respect eachother's good opinion are less likely to be killed than those who donot, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory.\"thus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back thetrojans. they laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with awall of bronze, while jove urged on the trojans. menelaus of the loudbattle-cry urged antilochus on. \"antilochus,\" said he, \"you are youngand there is none of the achaeans more fleet of foot or more valiantthan you are. see if you cannot spring upon some trojan and kill him.\"he hurried away when he had thus spurred antilochus, who at once dartedout from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking carefullyround him. the trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart did notspeed from his hand without effect, for it struck melanippus the proudson of hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward,and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to theground. antilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which ahunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and killed it.even so, o melanippus, did stalwart antilochus spring upon you to stripyou of your armour; but noble hector marked him, and came running up tohim through the thick of the battle. antilochus, brave soldier thoughhe was, would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage creaturewhich knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed a dog or aman who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can be gathered toattack it. even so did the son of nestor fly, and the trojans andhector with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons after him;nor did he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached hiscomrades.the trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the shipsin fulfilment of the behests of jove who kept spurring them on to newdeeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the argives anddefeated them by encouraging the trojans. for he meant giving glory tohector son of priam, and letting him throw fire upon the ships, till hehad fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that thetis had made him; jove,therefore, bided his time till he should see the glare of a blazingship. from that hour he was about so to order that the trojans shouldbe driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory to the achaeans.with this purpose he inspired hector son of priam, who was eager enoughalready, to assail the ships. his fury was as that of mars, or as whena fire is raging in the glades of some dense forest upon the mountains;he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible eye-brows,and his helmet quivered on his temples by reason of the fury with whichhe fought. jove from heaven was with him, and though he was but oneagainst many, vouchsafed him victory and glory; for he was doomed to anearly death, and already pallas minerva was hurrying on the hour of hisdestruction at the hands of the son of peleus. now, however, he kepttrying to break the ranks of the enemy wherever he could see themthickest, and in the goodliest armour; but do what he might he couldnot break through them, for they stood as a tower foursquare, or assome high cliff rising from the grey sea that braves the anger of thegale, and of the waves that thunder up against it. he fell upon themlike flames of fire from every quarter. as when a wave, raised mountainhigh by wind and storm, breaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam,the fierce winds roar against the mast, the hearts of the sailors failthem for fear, and they are saved but by a very little fromdestruction--even so were the hearts of the achaeans fainting withinthem. or as a savage lion attacking a herd of cows while they arefeeding by thousands in the low-lying meadows by some wide-wateredshore--the herdsman is at his wit's end how to protect his herd andkeeps going about now in the van and now in the rear of his cattle,while the lion springs into the thick of them and fastens on a cow sothat they all tremble for fear--even so were the achaeans utterlypanic-stricken by hector and father jove. nevertheless hector onlykilled periphetes of mycenae; he was son of copreus who was wont totake the orders of king eurystheus to mighty hercules, but the son wasa far better man than the father in every way; he was fleet of foot, avaliant warrior, and in understanding ranked among the foremost men ofmycenae. he it was who then afforded hector a triumph, for as he wasturning back he stumbled against the rim of his shield which reachedhis feet, and served to keep the javelins off him. he tripped againstthis and fell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head ashe did so. hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust aspear into his chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. these,for all their sorrow, could not help him for they were themselvesterribly afraid of hector.they had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had beendrawn up first were on every side of them, but the trojans came pouringafter them. the argives were driven back from the first row of ships,but they made a stand by their tents without being broken up andscattered; shame and fear restrained them. they kept shoutingincessantly to one another, and nestor of gerene, tower of strength tothe achaeans, was loudest in imploring every man by his parents, andbeseeching him to stand firm.\"be men, my friends,\" he cried, \"and respect one another's goodopinion. think, all of you, on your children, your wives, yourproperty, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. on theirbehalf though they are not here, i implore you to stand firm, and notto turn in flight.\"with these words he put heart and soul into them all. minerva liftedthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell uponthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight wasraging. they could see hector and all his men, both those in the rearwho were taking no part in the battle, and those who were fighting bythe ships.ajax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but strodefrom deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve cubits longand jointed with rings. as a man skilled in feats of horsemanshipcouples four horses together and comes tearing full speed along thepublic way from the country into some large town--many both men andwomen marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time changing hishorse, springing from one to another without ever missing his feetwhile the horses are at a gallop--even so did ajax go striding from oneship's deck to another, and his voice went up into the heavens. he kepton shouting his orders to the danaans and exhorting them to defendtheir ships and tents; neither did hector remain within the main bodyof the trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon a flock ofwild-fowl feeding near a river--geese, it may be, or cranes, orlong-necked swans--even so did hector make straight for a dark-prowedship, rushing right towards it; for jove with his mighty hand impelledhim forward, and roused his people to follow him.and now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. you would havethought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely didthey fight; and this was the mind in which they were--the achaeans didnot believe they should escape destruction but thought themselvesdoomed, while there was not a trojan but his heart beat high with thehope of firing the ships and putting the achaean heroes to the sword.thus were the two sides minded. then hector seized the stern of thegood ship that had brought protesilaus to troy, but never bore him backto his native land. round this ship there raged a close hand-to-handfight between danaans and trojans. they did not fight at a distancewith bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at one another inclose combat with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends;they fought moreover with keen battle-axes and with hatchets. many agood stout blade hilted and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand orshoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red with blood. hector, whenhe had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but held on to itscurved stern and shouted to the trojans, \"bring fire, and raise thebattle-cry all of you with a single voice. now has jove vouchsafed us aday that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take the shipswhich came hither against heaven's will, and which have caused us suchinfinite suffering through the cowardice of our councillors, who when iwould have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade the hostto follow me; if jove did then indeed warp our judgements, himself nowcommands me and cheers me on.\"as he spoke thus the trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the achaeans,and ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by the dartsthat were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed. therefore heleft the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to theseven-foot bench of the oarsmen. here he stood on the look-out, andwith his spear held back any trojan whom he saw bringing fire to theships. all the time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice andexhorting the danaans. \"my friends,\" he cried, \"danaan heroes, servantsof mars, be men my friends, and fight with might and with main. can wehope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely thanthe one we have? there is no strong city within reach, whence we maydraw fresh forces to turn the scales in our favour. we are on the plainof the armed trojans with the sea behind us, and far from our owncountry. our salvation, therefore, is in the might of our hands and inhard fighting.\"as he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when anytrojan made towards the ships with fire at hector's bidding, he wouldbe on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long spear.twelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the ships.book xvi  fire being now thrown on the ship of protesilaus, patroclus  fights in the armour of achilles--he drives the trojans back,  but is in the end killed by euphorbus and hector.thus did they fight about the ship of protesilaus. then patroclus drewnear to achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some springwhose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice. whenachilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said, \"why,patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child that comesrunning to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried--she catcheshold of her mother's dress to stay her though she is in a hurry, andlooks tearfully up until her mother carries her--even such tears,patroclus, are you now shedding. have you anything to say to themyrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from phthia which youalone know? they tell me menoetius son of actor is still alive, as alsopeleus son of aeacus, among the myrmidons--men whose loss we two shouldbitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the argives and the way inwhich they are being killed at the ships, through their own high-handeddoings? do not hide anything from me but tell me that both of us mayknow about it.\"then, o knight patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered, \"achilles, sonof peleus, foremost champion of the achaeans, do not be angry, but iweep for the disaster that has now befallen the argives. all those whohave been their champions so far are lying at the ships, wounded bysword or spear. brave diomed son of tydeus has been hit with a spear,while famed ulysses and agamemnon have received sword-wounds; eurypylusagain has been struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled apothecariesare attending to these heroes, and healing them of their wounds; areyou still, o achilles, so inexorable? may it never be my lot to nursesuch a passion as you have done, to the baning of your own good name.who in future story will speak well of you unless you now save theargives from ruin? you know no pity; knight peleus was not your fathernor thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore you and the sheer cliffsbegot you, so cruel and remorseless are you. if however you are keptback through knowledge of some oracle, or if your mother thetis hastold you something from the mouth of jove, at least send me and themyrmidons with me, if i may bring deliverance to the danaans. let memoreover wear your armour; the trojans may thus mistake me for you andquit the field, so that the hard-pressed sons of the achaeans may havebreathing time--which while they are fighting may hardly be. we who arefresh might soon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to theirown city.\"he knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his owndestruction. achilles was deeply moved and answered, \"what, noblepatroclus, are you saying? i know no prophesyings which i am heeding,nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of jove, but i am cutto the very heart that one of my own rank should dare to rob me becausehe is more powerful than i am. this, after all that i have gonethrough, is more than i can endure. the girl whom the sons of theachaeans chose for me, whom i won as the fruit of my spear on havingsacked a city--her has king agamemnon taken from me as though i weresome common vagrant. still, let bygones be bygones: no man may keep hisanger for ever; i said i would not relent till battle and the cry ofwar had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my armour aboutyour shoulders, and lead the myrmidons to battle, for the dark cloud oftrojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the argives are driven backon to the beach, cooped within a narrow space, and the whole people oftroy has taken heart to sally out against them, because they see notthe visor of my helmet gleaming near them. had they seen this, therewould not have been a creek nor grip that had not been filled withtheir dead as they fled back again. and so it would have been, if onlyking agamemnon had dealt fairly by me. as it is the trojans have besetour host. diomed son of tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend thedanaans, neither have i heard the voice of the son of atreus comingfrom his hated head, whereas that of murderous hector rings in my carsas he gives orders to the trojans, who triumph over the achaeans andfill the whole plain with their cry of battle. but even so, patroclus,fall upon them and save the fleet, lest the trojans fire it and preventus from being able to return. do, however, as i now bid you, that youmay win me great honour from all the danaans, and that they may restorethe girl to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. when youhave driven the trojans from the ships, come back again. though juno'sthundering husband should put triumph within your reach, do not fightthe trojans further in my absence, or you will rob me of glory thatshould be mine. and do not for lust of battle go on killing the trojansnor lead the achaeans on to ilius, lest one of the ever-living godsfrom olympus attack you--for phoebus apollo loves them well: returnwhen you have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage war uponthe plain. would, by father jove, minerva, and apollo, that not asingle man of all the trojans might be left alive, nor yet of theargives, but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantlethat veils the brow of troy.\"thus did they converse. but ajax could no longer hold his ground forthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of jove and thejavelins of the trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamedabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles thatkept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected hisface. moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his shieldso long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they could notmake him give ground. he could hardly draw his breath, the sweat rainedfrom every pore of his body, he had not a moment's respite, and on allsides he was beset by danger upon danger.and now, tell me, o muses that hold your mansions on olympus, how firewas thrown upon the ships of the achaeans. hector came close up and letdrive with his great sword at the ashen spear of ajax. he cut it cleanin two just behind where the point was fastened on to the shaft of thespear. ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headless spear, while thebronze point flew some way off and came ringing down on to the ground.ajax knew the hand of heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing thatjove had now left him utterly defenceless and was willing victory forthe trojans. therefore he drew back, and the trojans flung fire uponthe ship which was at once wrapped in flame.the fire was now flaring about the ship's stern, whereon achilles smotehis two thighs and said to patroclus, \"up, noble knight, for i see theglare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy our ships,and there be no way by which we may retreat. gird on your armour atonce while i call our people together.\"as he spoke patroclus put on his armour. first he greaved his legs withgreaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver; afterthis he donned the cuirass of the son of aeacus, richly inlaid andstudded. he hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about hisshoulders, and then his mighty shield. on his comely head he set hishelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacinglyabove it. he grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his hands, buthe did not take the spear of noble achilles, so stout and strong, fornone other of the achaeans could wield it, though achilles could do soeasily. this was the ashen spear from mount pelion, which chiron hadcut upon a mountain top and had given to peleus, wherewith to deal outdeath among heroes. he bade automedon yoke his horses with all speed,for he was the man whom he held in honour next after achilles, and onwhose support in battle he could rely most firmly. automedon thereforeyoked the fleet horses xanthus and balius, steeds that could fly likethe wind: these were they whom the harpy podarge bore to the west wind,as she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the river oceanus. inthe side traces he set the noble horse pedasus, whom achilles hadbrought away with him when he sacked the city of eetion, and who,mortal steed though he was, could take his place along with those thatwere immortal.meanwhile achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade hismyrmidons put on their armour. even as fierce ravening wolves that arefeasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the mountains,and their jaws are red with blood--they go in a pack to lap water fromthe clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they reek of bloodand slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is hunger drivesthem--even so did the leaders and counsellors of the myrmidons gatherround the good squire of the fleet descendant of aeacus, and among themstood achilles himself cheering on both men and horses.fifty ships had noble achilles brought to troy, and in each there was acrew of fifty oarsmen. over these he set five captains whom he couldtrust, while he was himself commander over them all. menesthius of thegleaming corslet, son to the river spercheius that streams from heaven,was captain of the first company. fair polydora daughter of peleus borehim to ever-flowing spercheius--a woman mated with a god--but he wascalled son of borus son of perieres, with whom his mother was living ashis wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to gain her. the secondcompany was led by noble eudorus, son to an unwedded woman. polymele,daughter of phylas the graceful dancer, bore him; the mighty slayer ofargos was enamoured of her as he saw her among the singing women at adance held in honour of diana the rushing huntress of the goldenarrows; he therefore--mercury, giver of all good--went with her into anupper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a nobleson eudorus, singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. whenilithuia goddess of the pains of child-birth brought him to the lightof day, and he saw the face of the sun, mighty echecles son of actortook the mother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain her, but herfather phylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting asfondly upon him as though he were his own son. the third company wasled by pisander son of maemalus, the finest spearman among all themyrmidons next to achilles' own comrade patroclus. the old knightphoenix was captain of the fourth company, and alcimedon, noble son oflaerceus of the fifth.when achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with theircaptains, he charged them straitly saying, \"myrmidons, remember yourthreats against the trojans while you were at the ships in the time ofmy anger, and you were all complaining of me. 'cruel son of peleus,'you would say, 'your mother must have suckled you on gall, so ruthlessare you. you keep us here at the ships against our will; if you are sorelentless it were better we went home over the sea.' often have yougathered and thus chided with me. the hour is now come for those highfeats of arms that you have so long been pining for, therefore keephigh hearts each one of you to do battle with the trojans.\"with these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they serriedtheir companies yet more closely when they heard the words of theirking. as the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high housewhich is to give shelter from the winds--even so closely were thehelmets and bossed shields set against one another. shield pressed onshield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they that thehorse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched eachother as they bent their heads.in front of them all two men put on their armour--patroclus andautomedon--two men, with but one mind to lead the myrmidons. thenachilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chestwhich silver-footed thetis had given him to take on board ship, andwhich she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and goodthick rugs. in this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from whichno man but himself might drink, nor would he make offering from it toany other god save only to father jove. he took the cup from the chestand cleansed it with sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, andafter he had washed his hands he drew wine. then he stood in the middleof the court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making hisdrink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of jove whose joy is inthunder. \"king jove,\" he cried, \"lord of dodona, god of the pelasgi,who dwellest afar, you who hold wintry dodona in your sway, where yourprophets the selli dwell around you with their feet unwashed and theircouches made upon the ground--if you heard me when i prayed to youaforetime, and did me honour while you sent disaster on the achaeans,vouchsafe me now the fulfilment of yet this further prayer. i shallstay here where my ships are lying, but i shall send my comrade intobattle at the head of many myrmidons. grant, o all-seeing jove, thatvictory may go with him; put your courage into his heart that hectormay learn whether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whetherhis might is only then so indomitable when i myself enter the turmoilof war. afterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of battlefrom the ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with his armour andhis comrades, fighters in close combat.\"thus did he pray, and all-counselling jove heard his prayer. part of ithe did indeed vouchsafe him--but not the whole. he granted thatpatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but refusedto let him come safely out of the fight.when he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, achilles wentinside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.then he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fiercefight that raged between the trojans and achaeans.meanwhile the armed band that was about patroclus marched on till theysprang high in hope upon the trojans. they came swarming out like waspswhose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love to tease,whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung--or again, if awayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident, every wasp willcome flying out in a fury to defend his little ones--even with suchrage and courage did the myrmidons swarm from their ships, and theircry of battle rose heavenwards. patroclus called out to his men at thetop of his voice, \"myrmidons, followers of achilles son of peleus, bemen my friends, fight with might and with main, that we may win gloryfor the son of peleus, who is far the foremost man at the ships of theargives--he, and his close fighting followers. the son of atreus kingagamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing no respect to thebravest of the achaeans.\"with these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they fell ina body upon the trojans. the ships rang again with the cry which theachaeans raised, and when the trojans saw the brave son of menoetiusand his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were daunted andtheir battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought the fleetson of peleus must now have put aside his anger, and have beenreconciled to agamemnon; every one, therefore, looked round about tosee whither he might fly for safety.patroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where menwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of protesilaus. hehit pyraechmes who had led his paeonian horsemen from the amydon andthe broad waters of the river axius; the spear struck him on the rightshoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on this hismen were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader, who wasthe finest soldier among them, patroclus struck panic into them all. hethus drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that was thenblazing--leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was. the trojanswere now driven back with a shout that rent the skies, while thedanaans poured after them from their ships, shouting also withoutceasing. as when jove, gatherer of the thunder-cloud, spreads a densecanopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and all the peaks, thejutting headlands, and forest glades show out in the great light thatflashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the danaans had nowdriven back the fire from their ships, they took breath for a littlewhile; but the fury of the fight was not yet over, for the trojans werenot driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle, and were oustedfrom their ground only by sheer fighting.the fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed oneanother when and how they could. the valiant son of menoetius firstdrove his spear into the thigh of areilycus just as he was turninground; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so that he fellforward. meanwhile menelaus struck thoas in the chest, where it wasexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. the son ofphyleus saw amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he could do so tookaim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are thicker thanin any other part; the spear tore through all the sinews of the leg,and his eyes were closed in darkness. of the sons of nestor one,antilochus, speared atymnius, driving the point of the spear throughhis throat, and down he fell. maris then sprang on antilochus inhand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body spearin hand; but valiant thrasymedes was too quick for him, and in a momenthad struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow; his aim wastrue, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root of his arm, andtore them right down to the bone, so he fell heavily to the ground andhis eyes were closed in darkness. thus did these two noble comrades ofsarpedon go down to erebus slain by the two sons of nestor; they werethe warrior sons of amisodorus, who had reared the invincible chimaera,to the bane of many. ajax son of oileus sprang on cleobulus and tookhim alive as he was entangled in the crush; but he killed him then andthere by a sword-blow on the neck. the sword reeked with his blood,while dark death and the strong hand of fate gripped him and closed hiseyes.peneleos and lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed eachother with their spears. they had both thrown without effect, so nowthey drew their swords. lycon struck the plumed crest of peneleos'helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while peneleos smote lycon onthe neck under the ear. the blade sank so deep that the head was heldon by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in him.meriones gave chase to acamas on foot and caught him up just as he wasabout to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through his right shoulderso that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyes were closed indarkness. idomeneus speared erymas in the mouth; the bronze point ofthe spear went clean through it beneath the brain, crashing in amongthe white bones and smashing them up. his teeth were all of themknocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his eyes;it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, and the darknessof death enfolded him round about.thus did these chieftains of the danaans each of them kill his man. asravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when they arealone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock through thecarelessness of the shepherd--and when the wolves see this they pounceupon them at once because they cannot defend themselves--even so didthe danaans now fall on the trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries intheir panic and had no more fight left in them.meanwhile great ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into hector, buthector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well under coverof his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing of thearrows and the heavy thud of the spears. he well knew that the fortunesof the day had changed, but still stood his ground and tried to protecthis comrades.as when a cloud goes up into heaven from olympus, rising out of a clearsky when jove is brewing a gale--even with such panic stricken rout didthe trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going. hector'sfleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and he left thetrojan host penned in by the deep trench against their will. many ayoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in the trench andleft their master's car behind them. patroclus gave chase, callingimpetuously on the danaans and full of fury against the trojans, who,being now no longer in a body, filled all the ways with their cries ofpanic and rout; the air was darkened with the clouds of dust theyraised, and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from thetents and ships towards the city.patroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying inconfusion, cheering on his men the while. chariots were being smashedin all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from his own carto fall beneath the wheels of that of patroclus, whose immortal steeds,given by the gods to peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound as theysped onward. he was intent on trying to get near hector, for he had sethis heart on spearing him, but hector's horses were now hurrying himaway. as the whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn daywhen jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving crooked judgementin their courts, and driving justice therefrom without heed to thedecrees of heaven--all the rivers run full and the torrents tear many anew channel as they roar headlong from the mountains to the dark sea,and it fares ill with the works of men--even such was the stress andstrain of the trojan horses in their flight.patroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and drovethem back to the ships. they were doing their best to reach the city,but he would not let them, and bore down on them between the river andthe ships and wall. many a fallen comrade did he then avenge. first hehit pronous with a spear on the chest where it was exposed near the rimof his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground. next he sprang onthestor son of enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot,for he had lost his head and the reins had been torn out of his hands.patroclus went up to him and drove a spear into his right jaw; he thushooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled him over the rim of hiscar, as one who sits at the end of some jutting rock and draws a strongfish out of the sea with a hook and a line--even so with his spear didhe pull thestor all gaping from his chariot; he then threw him down onhis face and he died while falling. on this, as erylaus was on comingto attack him, he struck him full on the head with a stone, and hisbrains were all battered inside his helmet, whereon he fell headlong tothe ground and the pangs of death took hold upon him. then he laid low,one after the other, erymas, amphoterus, epaltes, tlepolemus, echiusson of damastor, pyris, ipheus, euippus and polymelus son of argeas.now when sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,being overcome by patroclus son of menoetius, he rebuked the lycianssaying. \"shame on you, where are you flying to? show your mettle; iwill myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is somasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave manupon the ground.\"he sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and patroclus, when he sawthis, leaped on to the ground also. the two then rushed at one anotherwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that screamand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness.the son of scheming saturn looked down upon them in pity and said tojuno who was his wife and sister, \"alas, that it should be the lot ofsarpedon whom i love so dearly to perish by the hand of patroclus. i amin two minds whether to catch him up out of the fight and set him downsafe and sound in the fertile land of lycia, or to let him now fall bythe hand of the son of menoetius.\"and juno answered, \"most dread son of saturn, what is this that you aresaying? would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been fated,out of the jaws of death? do as you will, but we shall not all of us beof your mind. i say further, and lay my saying to your heart, that ifyou send sarpedon safely to his own home, some other of the gods willbe also wanting to escort his son out of battle, for there are manysons of gods fighting round the city of troy, and you will make everyone jealous. if, however, you are fond of him and pity him, let himindeed fall by the hand of patroclus, but as soon as the life is goneout of him, send death and sweet sleep to bear him off the field andtake him to the broad lands of lycia, where his brothers and hiskinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in due honour to the dead.\"the sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood upon theearth in honour of his son whom patroclus was about to kill on the richplain of troy far from his home.when they were now come close to one another patroclus struckthrasydemus, the brave squire of sarpedon, in the lower part of thebelly, and killed him. sarpedon then aimed a spear at patroclus andmissed him, but he struck the horse pedasus in the right shoulder, andit screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life wentout of it. the other two horses began to plunge; the pole of thechariot cracked and they got entangled in the reins through the fall ofthe horse that was yoked along with them; but automedon knew what todo; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung byhis sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the other tworighted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went togetherinto battle.sarpedon now took a second aim at patroclus, and again missed him, thepoint of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting him.patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from his handin vain, for he hit sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds theever-beating heart. he fell like some oak or silver poplar or tall pineto which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains to make timberfor ship-building--even so did he lie stretched at full length in frontof his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-staineddust. as when a lion springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle andfastens on a great black bull which dies bellowing in itsclutches--even so did the leader of the lycian warriors struggle indeath as he fell by the hand of patroclus. he called on his trustycomrade and said, \"glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forthall your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit yourselflike a valiant soldier. first go about among the lycian captains andbid them fight for sarpedon; then yourself also do battle to save myarmour from being taken. my name will haunt you henceforth and for everif the achaeans rob me of my armour now that i have fallen at theirships. do your very utmost and call all my people together.\"death closed his eyes as he spoke. patroclus planted his heel on hisbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came outalong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and sarpedon's soul atthe same time. hard by the myrmidons held his snorting steeds, who werewild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.glaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what sarpedon said, forhe could not help him. he had to support his arm with his other hand,being in great pain through the wound which teucer's arrow had givenhim when teucer was defending the wall as he, glaucus, was assailingit. therefore he prayed to far-darting apollo saying, \"hear me o kingfrom your seat, may be in the rich land of lycia, or may be in troy,for in all places you can hear the prayer of one who is in distress, asi now am. i have a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, thereis no staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason of myhurt, so that i cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and fightthem, though our prince, jove's son sarpedon, is slain. jove defendednot his son, do you, therefore, o king, heal me of my wound, ease mypain and grant me strength both to cheer on the lycians and to fightalong with them round the body of him who has fallen.\"thus did he pray, and apollo heard his prayer. he eased his pain,staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.glaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god hadanswered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the lyciancaptains, and bade them come to fight about the body of sarpedon. fromthese he strode on among the trojans to polydamas son of panthous andagenor; he then went in search of aeneas and hector, and when he hadfound them he said, \"hector, you have utterly forgotten your allies,who languish here for your sake far from friends and home while you donothing to support them. sarpedon leader of the lycian warriors hasfallen--he who was at once the right and might of lycia; mars has laidhim low by the spear of patroclus. stand by him, my friends, and suffernot the myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to treat his bodywith contumely in revenge for all the danaans whom we have speared atthe ships.\"as he spoke the trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable grief;for sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main stays oftheir city, both as having much people with him, and himself theforemost among them all. led by hector, who was infuriated by the fallof sarpedon, they made instantly for the danaans with all their might,while the undaunted spirit of patroclus son of menoetius cheered on theachaeans. first he spoke to the two ajaxes, men who needed no bidding.\"ajaxes,\" said he, \"may it now please you to show yourselves the menyou have always been, or even better--sarpedon is fallen--he who wasfirst to overleap the wall of the achaeans; let us take the body andoutrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders, and kill hiscomrades if they try to rescue his body.\"he spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,therefore, the trojans and lycians on the one hand, and the myrmidonsand achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions, and foughtdesperately about the body of sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while.mighty was the din of their armour as they came together, and jove sheda thick darkness over the fight, to increase the toil of the battleover the body of his son.at first the trojans made some headway against the achaeans, for one ofthe best men among the myrmidons was killed, epeigeus, son of nobleagacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of budeum; butpresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refugewith peleus and thetis, who sent him to ilius the land of noble steedsto fight the trojans under achilles. hector now struck him on the headwith a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, and his brainsinside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell face foremostupon the body of sarpedon, and there died. patroclus was enraged by thedeath of his comrade, and sped through the front ranks as swiftly as ahawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings. even so swiftly,o noble knight patroclus, did you make straight for the lycians andtrojans to avenge your comrade. forthwith he struck sthenelaus the sonof ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and broke the tendons that joinit to the head and spine. on this hector and the front rank of his mengave ground. as far as a man can throw a javelin when competing forsome prize, or even in battle--so far did the trojans now retreatbefore the achaeans. glaucus, captain of the lycians, was the first torally them, by killing bathycles son of chalcon who lived in hellas andwas the richest man among the myrmidons. glaucus turned round suddenly,just as bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him,and drove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fellheavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled theachaeans with dismay, while the trojans were exultant, and came up in abody round the corpse. nevertheless the achaeans, mindful of theirprowess, bore straight down upon them.meriones then killed a helmed warrior of the trojans, laogonus son ofonetor, who was priest of jove of mt. ida, and was honoured by thepeople as though he were a god. meriones struck him under the jaw andear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of death laid holdupon him. aeneas then aimed a spear at meriones, hoping to hit himunder the shield as he was advancing, but meriones saw it coming andstooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and thepoint stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering tillmars robbed it of its force. the spear, therefore, sped from aeneas'shand in vain and fell quivering to the ground. aeneas was angry andsaid, \"meriones, you are a good dancer, but if i had hit you my spearwould soon have made an end of you.\"and meriones answered, \"aeneas, for all your bravery, you will not beable to make an end of every one who comes against you. you are only amortal like myself, and if i were to hit you in the middle of yourshield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you may be, ishould soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to hades of thenoble steeds.\"on this the son of menoetius rebuked him and said, \"meriones, herothough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my goodfriend, will not make the trojans draw away from the dead body; some ofthem must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words forcouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing.\"he led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. as thesound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains--and thethud of their axes is heard afar--even such a din now rose fromearth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as men smoteeach other with their swords and spears pointed at both ends. a man hadneed of good eyesight now to know sarpedon, so covered was he from headto foot with spears and blood and dust. men swarmed about the body, asflies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring when they arebrimming with milk--even so did they gather round sarpedon; nor didjove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight, but keptlooking at it all the time, for he was settling how best to killpatroclus, and considering whether hector should be allowed to end himnow in the fight round the body of sarpedon, and strip him of hisarmour, or whether he should let him give yet further trouble to thetrojans. in the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire ofachilles son of peleus should drive hector and the trojans back towardsthe city and take the lives of many. first, therefore, he made hectorturn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and fled, bidding theother trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales of jove had turnedagainst him. neither would the brave lycians stand firm; they weredismayed when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heapof corpses--for when the son of saturn made the fight wax hot many hadfallen above him. the achaeans, therefore stripped the gleaming armourfrom his shoulders and the brave son of menoetius gave it to his men totake to the ships. then jove lord of the storm-cloud said to apollo,\"dear phoebus, go, i pray you, and take sarpedon out of range of theweapons; cleanse the black blood from off him, and then bear him a longway off where you may wash him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia,and clothe him in immortal raiment; this done, commit him to the armsof the two fleet messengers, death, and sleep, who will carry himstraightway to the rich land of lycia, where his brothers and kinsmenwill inter him, and will raise both mound and pillar to his memory, indue honour to the dead.\"thus he spoke. apollo obeyed his father's saying, and came down fromthe heights of ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he tooksarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way off,where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia andclothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to thearms of the two fleet messengers, death, and sleep, who presently sethim down in the rich land of lycia.meanwhile patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to automedon,pursued the trojans and lycians in the pride and foolishness of hisheart. had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of peleus, he wouldhave escaped death and have been scatheless; but the counsels of jovepass man's understanding; he will put even a brave man to flight andsnatch victory from his grasp, or again he will set him on to fight, ashe now did when he put a high spirit into the heart of patroclus.who then first, and who last, was slain by you, o patroclus, when thegods had now called you to meet your doom? first adrestus, autonous,echeclus, perimus the son of megas, epistor and melanippus; after thesehe killed elasus, mulius, and pylartes. these he slew, but the restsaved themselves by flight.the sons of the achaeans would now have taken troy by the hands ofpatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not phoebus apollotaken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid thetrojans. thrice did patroclus charge at an angle of the high wall, andthrice did apollo beat him back, striking his shield with his ownimmortal hands. when patroclus was coming on like a god for yet afourth time, apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said, \"drawback, noble patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of thetrojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of achilles who is a farbetter man than you are.\" on hearing this, patroclus withdrew to somedistance and avoided the anger of apollo.meanwhile hector was waiting with his horses inside the scaean gates,in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to call thearmy inside the gates. as he was thus doubting phoebus apollo drew nearhim in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior asius, who washector's uncle, being own brother to hecuba, and son of dymas who livedin phrygia by the waters of the river sangarius; in his likeness jove'sson apollo now spoke to hector saying, \"hector, why have you left offfighting? it is ill done of you. if i were as much better a man thanyou, as i am worse, you should soon rue your slackness. drive straighttowards patroclus, if so be that apollo may grant you a triumph overhim, and you may rule him.\"with this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and hector badecebriones drive again into the fight. apollo passed in among them, andstruck panic into the argives, while he gave triumph to hector and thetrojans. hector let the other danaans alone and killed no man, butdrove straight at patroclus. patroclus then sprang from his chariot tothe ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jaggedstone as large as his hand could hold. he stood still and threw it, nordid it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, forthe stone struck cebriones, hector's charioteer, a bastard son ofpriam, as he held the reins in his hands. the stone hit him on theforehead and drove his brows into his head for the bone was smashed,and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. he dropped dead from hischariot as though he were diving, and there was no more life left inhim. over him did you then vaunt, o knight patroclus, saying, \"bless myheart, how active he is, and how well he dives. if we had been at seathis fellow would have dived from the ship's side and brought up asmany oysters as the whole crew could stomach, even in rough water, forhe has dived beautifully off his chariot on to the ground. it seems,then, that there are divers also among the trojans.\"as he spoke he flung himself on cebriones with the spring, as it were,of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck in thechest, and his courage is his own bane--even so furiously, o patroclus,did you then spring upon cebriones. hector sprang also from his chariotto the ground. the pair then fought over the body of cebriones. as twolions fight fiercely on some high mountain over the body of a stag thatthey have killed, even so did these two mighty warriors, patroclus sonof menoetius and brave hector, hack and hew at one another over thecorpse of cebriones. hector would not let him go when he had once gothim by the head, while patroclus kept fast hold of his feet, and afierce fight raged between the other danaans and trojans. as the eastand south wind buffet one another when they beat upon some dense foreston the mountains--there is beech and ash and spreading cornel; the topof the trees roar as they beat on one another, and one can hear theboughs cracking and breaking--even so did the trojans and achaeansspring upon one another and lay about each other, and neither sidewould give way. many a pointed spear fell to ground and many a wingedarrow sped from its bow-string about the body of cebriones; many agreat stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought around hisbody, but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge andhugely, heedless of his driving now.so long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of eitherside were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went downtowards the time when men loose their oxen, the achaeans proved to bebeyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew cebriones out of rangeof the darts and tumult of the trojans, and stripped the armour fromhis shoulders. then patroclus sprang like mars with fierce intent and aterrific shout upon the trojans, and thrice did he kill nine men; butas he was coming on like a god for a time, then, o patroclus, was thehour of your end approaching, for phoebus fought you in fell earnest.patroclus did not see him as he moved about in the crush, for he wasenshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck him from behind on hisback and his broad shoulders with the flat of his hand, so that hiseyes turned dizzy. phoebus apollo beat the helmet from off his head,and it rolled rattling off under the horses' feet, where its horse-hairplumes were all begrimed with dust and blood. never indeed had thathelmet fared so before, for it had served to protect the head andcomely forehead of the godlike hero achilles. now, however, zeusdelivered it over to be worn by hector. nevertheless the end of hectoralso was near. the bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong, wasbroken in the hand of patroclus, while his shield that covered him fromhead to foot fell to the ground as did also the band that held it, andapollo undid the fastenings of his corslet.on this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he stood asone dazed; whereon euphorbus son of panthous a dardanian, the bestspearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner,came behind him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway betweenthe shoulders. this man as soon as ever he had come up with his chariothad dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts ofwar--he it was, o knight patroclus, that first drove a weapon into you,but he did not quite overpower you. euphorbus then ran back into thecrowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would notstand firm and wait for patroclus, unarmed though he now was, to attackhim; but patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god had given himand by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men in fear forhis life. hector on this, seeing him to be wounded and giving ground,forced his way through the ranks, and when close up with him struck himin the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving the bronze pointright through it, so that he fell heavily to the ground to the greatgrief of the achaeans. as when a lion has fought some fierce wild-boarand worsted him--the two fight furiously upon the mountains over somelittle fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beatenthe boar till he can hardly breathe--even so did hector son of priamtake the life of the brave son of menoetius who had killed so many,striking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him the while.\"patroclus,\" said he, \"you deemed that you should sack our city, robour trojan women of their freedom, and carry them off in your ships toyour own country. fool; hector and his fleet horses were ever strainingtheir utmost to defend them. i am foremost of all the trojan warriorsto stave the day of bondage from off them; as for you, vultures shalldevour you here. poor wretch, achilles with all his bravery availed younothing; and yet i ween when you left him he charged you straitlysaying, 'come not back to the ships, knight patroclus, till you haverent the bloodstained shirt of murderous hector about his body.' thus iween did he charge you, and your fool's heart answered him 'yea' withinyou.\"then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, o knight patroclus:\"hector, vaunt as you will, for jove the son of saturn and apollo havevouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so easily,and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders; had twentysuch men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen before myspear. fate and the son of leto have overpowered me, and among mortalmen euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the killing of me. i sayfurther, and lay my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for alittle season; death and the day of your doom are close upon you, andthey will lay you low by the hand of achilles son of aeacus.\"when he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul lefthis body and flitted down to the house of hades, mourning its sad fateand bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. dead thoughhe was, hector still spoke to him saying, \"patroclus, why should youthus foretell my doom? who knows but achilles, son of lovely thetis,may be smitten by my spear and die before me?\"as he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his footupon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. he thenwent spear in hand after automedon, squire of the fleet descendant ofaeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which thegods had given as a rich gift to peleus bore him swiftly from the field.book xvii  the fight around the body of patroclus.brave menelaus son of atreus now came to know that patroclus hadfallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armour tobestride him. as a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even so didyellow-haired menelaus bestride patroclus. he held his round shield andhis spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who should dare facehim. but the son of panthous had also noted the body, and came up tomenelaus saying, \"menelaus, son of atreus, draw back, leave the body,and let the bloodstained spoils be. i was first of the trojans andtheir brave allies to drive my spear into patroclus, let me, therefore,have my full glory among the trojans, or i will take aim and kill you.\"to this menelaus answered in great anger \"by father jove, boasting isan ill thing. the pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savagewild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures, thanare the proud sons of panthous. yet hyperenor did not see out the daysof his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming me themeanest soldier among the danaans. his own feet never bore him back togladden his wife and parents. even so shall i make an end of you too,if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and do not face me, orit shall be worse for you. even a fool may be wise after the event.\"euphorbus would not listen, and said, \"now indeed, menelaus, shall youpay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whose wifeyou widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief unspeakableon his parents. i shall comfort these poor people if i bring your headand armour and place them in the hands of panthous and noble phrontis.the time is come when this matter shall be fought out and settled, forme or against me.\"as he spoke he struck menelaus full on the shield, but the spear didnot go through, for the shield turned its point. menelaus then tookaim, praying to father jove as he did so; euphorbus was drawing back,and menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning hiswhole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. the point went cleanthrough his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fellheavily to the ground. his hair which was like that of the graces, andhis locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold, were allbedrabbled with blood. as one who has grown a fine young olive tree ina clear space where there is abundance of water--the plant is full ofpromise, and though the winds beat upon it from every quarter it putsforth its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce hurricane sweepdown upon it and level it with the ground--even so did menelaus stripthe fair youth euphorbus of his armour after he had slain him. or assome fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride of his strengthfastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding--first hebreaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then gorges on her blood andentrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry against him, but theystand aloof and will not come close to him, for they are pale withfear--even so no one had the courage to face valiant menelaus. the sonof atreus would have then carried off the armour of the son of panthouswith ease, had not phoebus apollo been angry, and in the guise ofmentes chief of the cicons incited hector to attack him. \"hector,\" saidhe, \"you are now going after the horses of the noble son of aeacus, butyou will not take them; they cannot be kept in hand and driven bymortal man, save only by achilles, who is son to an immortal mother.meanwhile menelaus son of atreus has bestridden the body of patroclusand killed the noblest of the trojans, euphorbus son of panthous, sothat he can fight no more.\"the god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul ofhector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranksand saw euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing fromhis wound, and menelaus stripping him of his armour. on this he madehis way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming armour,and crying with a loud voice. when the son of atreus heard him, he saidto himself in his dismay, \"alas! what shall i do? i may not let thetrojans take the armour of patroclus who has fallen fighting on mybehalf, lest some danaan who sees me should cry shame upon me. still iffor my honour's sake i fight hector and the trojans single-handed, theywill prove too many for me, for hector is bringing them up in force.why, however, should i thus hesitate? when a man fights in despite ofheaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue it. let nodanaan think ill of me if i give place to hector, for the hand ofheaven is with him. yet, if i could find ajax, the two of us wouldfight hector and heaven too, if we might only save the body ofpatroclus for achilles son of peleus. this, of many evils would be theleast.\"while he was thus in two minds, the trojans came up to him with hectorat their head; he therefore drew back and left the body, turning aboutlike some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men from astockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is daunted and slinkssulkily off--even so did menelaus son of atreus turn and leave the bodyof patroclus. when among the body of his men, he looked around formighty ajax son of telamon, and presently saw him on the extreme leftof the fight, cheering on his men and exhorting them to keep onfighting, for phoebus apollo had spread a great panic among them. heran up to him and said, \"ajax, my good friend, come with me at once todead patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to achilles--as forhis armour, hector already has it.\"these words stirred the heart of ajax, and he made his way among thefront ranks, menelaus going with him. hector had stripped patroclus ofhis armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take thebody to fling before the dogs of troy. but ajax came up with his shieldlike wall before him, on which hector withdrew under shelter of hismen, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to thetrojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; ajax,therefore, covered the body of patroclus with his broad shield andbestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have comeupon him in a forest when he is with his little ones--in the pride andfierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they coverhis eyes--even so did ajax bestride the body of patroclus, and by hisside stood menelaus son of atreus, nursing great sorrow in his heart.then glaucus son of hippolochus looked fiercely at hector and rebukedhim sternly. \"hector,\" said he, \"you make a brave show, but in fightyou are sadly wanting. a runaway like yourself has no claim to so greata reputation. think how you may now save your town and citadel by thehands of your own people born in ilius; for you will get no lycians tofight for you, seeing what thanks they have had for their incessanthardships. are you likely, sir, to do anything to help a man of lessnote, after leaving sarpedon, who was at once your guest and comrade inarms, to be the spoil and prey of the danaans? so long as he lived hedid good service both to your city and yourself; yet you had no stomachto save his body from the dogs. if the lycians will listen to me, theywill go home and leave troy to its fate. if the trojans had any of thatdaring fearless spirit which lays hold of men who are fighting fortheir country and harassing those who would attack it, we should soonbear off patroclus into ilius. could we get this dead man away andbring him into the city of priam, the argives would readily give up thearmour of sarpedon, and we should get his body to boot. for he whosesquire has been now killed is the foremost man at the ships of theachaeans--he and his close-fighting followers. nevertheless you darednot make a stand against ajax, nor face him, eye to eye, with battleall round you, for he is a braver man than you are.\"hector scowled at him and answered, \"glaucus, you should know better. ihave held you so far as a man of more understanding than any in alllycia, but now i despise you for saying that i am afraid of ajax. ifear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but jove's will isstronger than ours; jove at one time makes even a strong man draw backand snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will set himon to fight. come hither then, my friend, stand by me and see indeedwhether i shall play the coward the whole day through as you say, orwhether i shall not stay some even of the boldest danaans from fightinground the body of patroclus.\"as he spoke he called loudly on the trojans saying, \"trojans, lycians,and dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends, and fightmight and main, while i put on the goodly armour of achilles, which itook when i killed patroclus.\"with this hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men whowere taking the armour of achilles to troy, but had not yet got far.standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed hisarmour. his own he sent to the strong city of ilius and to the trojans,while he put on the immortal armour of the son of peleus, which thegods had given to peleus, who in his age gave it to his son; but theson did not grow old in his father's armour.when jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw hector standing aloof andarming himself in the armour of the son of peleus, he wagged his headand muttered to himself saying, \"a! poor wretch, you arm in the armourof a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck nothing ofthe doom that is already close upon you. you have killed his comrade sobrave and strong, but it was not well that you should strip the armourfrom his head and shoulders. i do indeed endow you with great mightnow, but as against this you shall not return from battle to lay thearmour of the son of peleus before andromache.\"the son of saturn bowed his portentous brows, and hector fitted thearmour to his body, while terrible mars entered into him, and filledhis whole body with might and valour. with a shout he strode in amongthe allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemed to allof them like the great son of peleus himself. he went about among themand cheered them on--mesthles, glaucus, medon, thersilochus,asteropaeus, deisenor and hippothous, phorcys, chromius and ennomus theaugur. all these did he exhort saying, \"hear me, allies from othercities who are here in your thousands, it was not in order to have acrowd about me that i called you hither each from his several city, butthat with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little ones ofthe trojans from the fierce achaeans. for this do i oppress my peoplewith your food and the presents that make you rich. therefore turn, andcharge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the game of war; whoevershall bring patroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of thetrojans, and shall make ajax give way before him, i will give him onehalf of the spoils while i keep the other. he will thus share likehonour with myself.\"when he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the danaans withtheir spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran high thathe should force ajax son of telamon to yield up the body--fools thatthey were, for he was about to take the lives of many. then ajax saidto menelaus, \"my good friend menelaus, you and i shall hardly come outof this fight alive. i am less concerned for the body of patroclus, whowill shortly become meat for the dogs and vultures of troy, than forthe safety of my own head and yours. hector has wrapped us round in astorm of battle from every quarter, and our destruction seems nowcertain. call then upon the princes of the danaans if there is any whocan hear us.\"menelaus did as he said, and shouted to the danaans for help at the topof his voice. \"my friends,\" he cried, \"princes and counsellors of theargives, all you who with agamemnon and menelaus drink at the publiccost, and give orders each to his own people as jove vouchsafes himpower and glory, the fight is so thick about me that i cannotdistinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, andthink it shame that patroclus should become meat and morsel for trojanhounds.\"fleet ajax son of oileus heard him and was first to force his waythrough the fight and run to help him. next came idomeneus and merioneshis esquire, peer of murderous mars. as for the others that came intothe fight after these, who of his own self could name them?the trojans with hector at their head charged in a body. as a greatwave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born river,and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the breakersthat beat and buffet them--even with such a roar did the trojans comeon; but the achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about the son ofmenoetius, and fenced him with their bronze shields. jove, moreover,hid the brightness of their helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borneno grudge against the son of menoetius while he was still alive andsquire to the descendant of aeacus; therefore he was loth to let himfall a prey to the dogs of his foes the trojans, and urged his comradeson to defend him.at first the trojans drove the achaeans back, and they withdrew fromthe dead man daunted. the trojans did not succeed in killing any one,nevertheless they drew the body away. but the achaeans did not lose itlong, for ajax, foremost of all the danaans after the son of peleusalike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and made towards thefront like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands at bay in theforest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that have attackedhim--even so did ajax son of telamon passing easily in among thephalanxes of the trojans, disperse those who had bestridden patroclusand were most bent on winning glory by dragging him off to their city.at this moment hippothous brave son of the pelasgian lethus, in hiszeal for hector and the trojans, was dragging the body off by the footthrough the press of the fight, having bound a strap round the sinewsnear the ancle; but a mischief soon befell him from which none of thosecould save him who would have gladly done so, for the son of telamonsprang forward and smote him on his bronze-cheeked helmet. the plumedheadpiece broke about the point of the weapon, struck at once by thespear and by the strong hand of ajax, so that the bloody brain cameoozing out through the crest-socket. his strength then failed him andhe let patroclus' foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length deadupon the body; thus he died far from the fertile land of larissa, andnever repaid his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life wascut short early by the spear of mighty ajax. hector then took aim atajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid it;the spear passed on and struck schedius son of noble iphitus, captainof the phoceans, who dwelt in famed panopeus and reigned over muchpeople; it struck him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronzepoint went right through him, coming out at the bottom of hisshoulder-blade, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fellheavily to the ground. ajax in his turn struck noble phorcys son ofphaenops in the middle of the belly as he was bestriding hippothous,and broke the plate of his cuirass; whereon the spear tore out hisentrails and he clutched the ground in his palm as he fell to earth.hector and those who were in the front rank then gave ground, while theargives raised a loud cry of triumph, and drew off the bodies ofphorcys and hippothous which they stripped presently of their armour.the trojans would now have been worsted by the brave achaeans anddriven back to ilius through their own cowardice, while the argives, sogreat was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a triumpheven against the will of jove, if apollo had not roused aeneas, in thelikeness of periphas son of epytus, an attendant who had grown old inthe service of aeneas' aged father, and was at all times devoted tohim. in his likeness, then, apollo said, \"aeneas, can you not manage,even though heaven be against us, to save high ilius? i have known men,whose numbers, courage, and self-reliance have saved their people inspite of jove, whereas in this case he would much rather give victoryto us than to the danaans, if you would only fight instead of being soterribly afraid.\"aeneas knew apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted tohector saying, \"hector and all other trojans and allies, shame on us ifwe are beaten by the achaeans and driven back to ilius through our owncowardice. a god has just come up to me and told me that jove thesupreme disposer will be with us. therefore let us make for thedanaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away deadpatroclus to the ships.\"as he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then ralliedand again faced the achaeans. aeneas speared leiocritus son of arisbas,a valiant follower of lycomedes, and lycomedes was moved with pity ashe saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared apisaon son ofhippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under the midriff, so thathe died; he had come from fertile paeonia and was the best man of themall after asteropaeus. asteropaeus flew forward to avenge him andattack the danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch as thoseabout patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held theirspears in front of them, for ajax had given them strict orders that noman was either to give ground, or to stand out before the others, butall were to hold well together about the body and fight hand to hand.thus did huge ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with blood as thecorpses fell thick on one another alike on the side of the trojans andallies, and on that of the danaans; for these last, too, fought nobloodless fight though many fewer of them perished, through the carethey took to defend and stand by one another.thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though ithad gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden over allthat part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the dead son ofmenoetius, whereas the other danaans and achaeans fought at their easein full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them, and there wasnot a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain. these lastmoreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting, for they weresome distance apart and beyond the range of one another's weapons,whereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered both frombattle and darkness. all the best of them were being worn out by thegreat weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes, thrasymedesand antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of patroclus, andbelieved him to be still alive and leading the van against the trojans;they were keeping themselves in reserve against the death or rout oftheir own comrades, for so nestor had ordered when he sent them fromthe ships into battle.thus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the sweatof their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their handsand eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of peleus. itwas as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to his men,and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in a ring and tugtill the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for the many thatpull at it, and it is well stretched--even so did the two sides tug thedead body hither and thither within the compass of but a littlespace--the trojans steadfastly set on dragging it into ilius, while theachaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships; and fierce wasthe fight between them. not mars himself the lord of hosts, nor yetminerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such a battle.such fearful turmoil of men and horses did jove on that day ordainround the body of patroclus. meanwhile achilles did not know that hehad fallen, for the fight was under the wall of troy a long way off theships. he had no idea, therefore, that patroclus was dead, and deemedthat he would return alive as soon as he had gone close up to thegates. he knew that he was not to sack the city neither with norwithout himself, for his mother had often told him this when he had satalone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels of great jove.now, however, she had not told him how great a disaster had befallenhim in the death of the one who was far dearest to him of all hiscomrades.the others still kept on charging one another round the body with theirpointed spears and killing each other. then would one say, \"my friends,we can never again show our faces at the ships--better, and greatlybetter, that earth should open and swallow us here in this place, thanthat we should let the trojans have the triumph of bearing offpatroclus to their city.\"the trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying, \"friends,though we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink fromfighting.\" with such words did they exhort each other. they fought andfought, and an iron clank rose through the void air to the brazen vaultof heaven. the horses of the descendant of aeacus stood out of thefight and wept when they heard that their driver had been laid low bythe hand of murderous hector. automedon, valiant son of diores, lashedthem again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and manya time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back to the shipsby the waters of the broad hellespont, nor yet into battle among theachaeans; they stood with their chariot stock still, as a pillar setover the tomb of some dead man or woman, and bowed their heads to theground. hot tears fell from their eyes as they mourned the loss oftheir charioteer, and their noble manes drooped all wet from under theyokestraps on either side the yoke.the son of saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. he waggedhis head, and muttered to himself, saying, \"poor things, why did wegive you to king peleus who is a mortal, while you are yourselvesageless and immortal? was it that you might share the sorrows thatbefall mankind? for of all creatures that live and move upon the earththere is none so pitiable as he is--still, hector son of priam shalldrive neither you nor your chariot. i will not have it. it is enoughthat he should have the armour over which he vaunts so vainly.furthermore i will give you strength of heart and limb to bearautomedon safely to the ships from battle, for i shall let the trojanstriumph still further, and go on killing till they reach the ships;whereon night shall fall and darkness overshadow the land.\"as he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that theyshook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariot swiftlyinto the fight that raged between trojans and achaeans. behind themfought automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture amid aflock of geese. in and out, and here and there, full speed he dashedamid the throng of the trojans, but for all the fury of his pursuit hekilled no man, for he could not wield his spear and keep his horses inhand when alone in the chariot; at last, however, a comrade, alcimedon,son of laerces son of haemon caught sight of him and came up behind hischariot. \"automedon,\" said he, \"what god has put this folly into yourheart and robbed you of your right mind, that you fight the trojans inthe front rank single-handed? he who was your comrade is slain, andhector plumes himself on being armed in the armour of the descendant ofaeacus.\"automedon son of diores answered, \"alcimedon, there is no one else whocan control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can, save onlypatroclus--while he was alive--peer of gods in counsel. take then thewhip and reins, while i go down from the car and fight.\"alcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and reins,while automedon leaped from off the car. when hector saw him he said toaeneas who was near him, \"aeneas, counsellor of the mail-clad trojans,i see the steeds of the fleet son of aeacus come into battle with weakhands to drive them. i am sure, if you think well, that we might takethem; they will not dare face us if we both attack them.\"the valiant son of anchises was of the same mind, and the pair wentright on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dryox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. chromius and aretus went also withthem, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill the menand capture the horses--fools that they were, for they were not toreturn scatheless from their meeting with automedon, who prayed tofather jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strengthabounding. he turned to his trusty comrade alcimedon and said,\"alcimedon, keep your horses so close up that i may feel their breathupon my back; i doubt that we shall not stay hector son of priam tillhe has killed us and mounted behind the horses; he will then eitherspread panic among the ranks of the achaeans, or himself be killedamong the foremost.\"on this he cried out to the two ajaxes and menelaus, \"ajaxes captainsof the argives, and menelaus, give the dead body over to them that arebest able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us living; for hectorand aeneas who are the two best men among the trojans, are pressing ushard in the full tide of war. nevertheless the issue lies on the lap ofheaven, i will therefore hurl my spear and leave the rest to jove.\"he poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the roundshield of aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed itnot, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part of hisbelly. as when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow behindthe horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck sothat it springs forward and then drops, even so did aretus give onebound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body till itmade an end of him. hector then aimed a spear at automedon but he sawit coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him andthe point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quiveringtill mars robbed it of its force. they would then have fought hand tohand with swords had not the two ajaxes forced their way through thecrowd when they heard their comrade calling, and parted them for alltheir fury--for hector, aeneas, and chromius were afraid and drew back,leaving aretus to lie there struck to the heart. automedon, peer offleet mars, then stripped him of his armour and vaunted over himsaying, \"i have done little to assuage my sorrow for the son ofmenoetius, for the man i have killed is not so good as he was.\"as he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon hischariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all steeped ingore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.and now the fierce groanful fight again raged about patroclus, forminerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command offar-seeing jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage thedanaans. as when jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token tomankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men from theirlabour and plague the flocks--even so, wrapped in such radiant raiment,did minerva go in among the host and speak man by man to each. firstshe took the form and voice of phoenix and spoke to menelaus son ofatreus, who was standing near her. \"menelaus,\" said she, \"it will beshame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade of achillesunder the walls of troy. therefore be staunch, and urge your men to beso also.\"menelaus answered, \"phoenix, my good old friend, may minerva vouchsafeme strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall i stand bypatroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but hector isas a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for jove is nowgranting him a time of triumph.\"minerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the othergods. therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders, and madehim as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet come again andbite if it can, so dearly does it love man's blood--even so bold asthis did she make him as he stood over patroclus and threw his spear.now there was among the trojans a man named podes, son of eetion, whowas both rich and valiant. hector held him in the highest honour for hewas his comrade and boon companion; the spear of menelaus struck thisman in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and went rightthrough him. whereon he fell heavily forward, and menelaus son ofatreus drew off his body from the trojans into the ranks of his ownpeople.apollo then went up to hector and spurred him on to fight, in thelikeness of phaenops son of asius who lived in abydos and was the mostfavoured of all hector's guests. in his likeness apollo said, \"hector,who of the achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you havequailed before menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?yet he has now got a corpse away from the trojans single-handed, andhas slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, podesson of eetion.\"a dark cloud of grief fell upon hector as he heard, and he made his wayto the front clad in full armour. thereon the son of saturn seized hisbright tasselled aegis, and veiled ida in cloud: he sent forth hislightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he gave victoryto the trojans and routed the achaeans.the panic was begun by peneleos the boeotian, for while keeping hisface turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on theupper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by polydamas had grazed thetop of the bone, for polydamas had come up to him and struck him fromclose at hand. then hector in close combat struck leitus son of noblealectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from fightingfurther. he looked about him in dismay, knowing that never again shouldhe wield spear in battle with the trojans. while hector was in pursuitof leitus, idomeneus struck him on the breastplate over his chest nearthe nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and the trojans cheeredaloud. hector then aimed at idomeneus son of deucalion as he wasstanding on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, but the spearhit coiranus, a follower and charioteer of meriones who had come withhim from lyctus. idomeneus had left the ships on foot and would haveafforded a great triumph to the trojans if coiranus had not drivenquickly up to him, he therefore brought life and rescue to idomeneus,but himself fell by the hand of murderous hector. for hector hit him onthe jaw under the ear; the end of the spear drove out his teeth and cuthis tongue in two pieces, so that he fell from his chariot and let thereins fall to the ground. meriones gathered them up from the ground andtook them into his own hands, then he said to idomeneus, \"lay on, tillyou get back to the ships, for you must see that the day is no longerours.\"on this idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had takenhold upon him.ajax and menelaus noted how jove had turned the scale in favour of thetrojans, and ajax was first to speak. \"alas,\" said he, \"even a fool maysee that father jove is helping the trojans. all their weapons strikehome; no matter whether it be a brave man or a coward that hurls them,jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one of them withouteffect. what, then, will be best both as regards rescuing the body, andour return to the joy of our friends who will be grieving as they lookhitherwards; for they will make sure that nothing can now check theterrible hands of hector, and that he will fling himself upon ourships. i wish that some one would go and tell the son of peleus atonce, for i do not think he can have yet heard the sad news that thedearest of his friends has fallen. but i can see not a man among theachaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike hidden indarkness. o father jove, lift this cloud from over the sons of theachaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will that weperish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.\"father jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. forthwith hechased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out and allthe fighting was revealed. ajax then said to menelaus, \"look, menelaus,and if antilochus son of nestor be still living, send him at once totell achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his comrades hasfallen.\"menelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from astockyard--the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keepwatch the whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat oftheir herd. in his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain,for darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunthim for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away--evenso did menelaus sorely against his will leave patroclus, in great fearlest the achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall intothe hands of the foe. he charged meriones and the two ajaxes straitlysaying, \"ajaxes and meriones, leaders of the argives, now indeedremember how good patroclus was; he was ever courteous while alive,bear it in mind now that he is dead.\"with this menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an eagle,whose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird--howeverhigh he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape him bycrouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it andmake an end of it--even so, o menelaus, did your keen eyes range roundthe mighty host of your followers to see if you could find the son ofnestor still alive. presently menelaus saw him on the extreme left ofthe battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight boldly.menelaus went up to him and said, \"antilochus, come here and listen tosad news, which i would indeed were untrue. you must see with your owneyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the danaans, and givingvictory to the trojans. patroclus has fallen, who was the bravest ofthe achaeans, and sorely will the danaans miss him. run instantly tothe ships and tell achilles, that he may come to rescue the body andbear it to the ships. as for the armour, hector already has it.\"antilochus was struck with horror. for a long time he was speechless;his eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance, but he didas menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had given hisarmour to a comrade, laodocus, who was wheeling his horses round, closebeside him.thus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news toachilles son of peleus. nor were you, o menelaus, minded to succour hisharassed comrades, when antilochus had left the pylians--and greatlydid they miss him--but he sent them noble thrasymedes, and himself wentback to patroclus. he came running up to the two ajaxes and said, \"ihave sent antilochus to the ships to tell achilles, but rage againsthector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour.what then will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead, andour own escape from death amid the battle-cries of the trojans?\"ajax answered, \"menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, andmeriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray, whilewe two behind you keep off hector and the trojans, one in heart as inname, and long used to fighting side by side with one another.\"on this menelaus and meriones took the dead man in their arms andlifted him high aloft with a great effort. the trojan host raised a hueand cry behind them when they saw the achaeans bearing the body away,and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at the loo ofa band of young huntsmen. for a while the hounds fly at him as thoughthey would tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns on them in afury, scaring and scattering them in all directions--even so did thetrojans for a while charge in a body, striking with sword and withspears pointed at both the ends, but when the two ajaxes faced them andstood at bay, they would turn pale and no man dared press on to fightfurther about the dead.in this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the body tothe ships out of the fight. the battle raged round them like fierceflames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city, and thehouses fall in the glare of its burning--even such was the roar andtramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore patroclus fromthe field. or as mules that put forth all their strength to draw somebeam or great piece of ship's timber down a rough mountain-track, andthey pant and sweat as they go--even so did menelaus and pant and sweatas they bore the body of patroclus. behind them the two ajaxes heldstoutly out. as some wooded mountain-spur that stretches across a plainwill turn water and check the flow even of a great river, nor is thereany stream strong enough to break through it--even so did the twoajaxes face the trojans and stem the tide of their fighting though theykept pouring on towards them and foremost among them all was aeneas sonof anchises with valiant hector. as a flock of daws or starlings fallto screaming and chattering when they see a falcon, foe to all smallbirds, come soaring near them, even so did the achaean youth raise ababel of cries as they fled before aeneas and hector, unmindful oftheir former prowess. in the rout of the danaans much goodly armourfell round about the trench, and of fighting there was no end.book xviii  the grief of achilles over patroclus--the visit of thetis  to vulcan and the armour that he made for achilles.thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. meanwhile the fleetrunner antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached achilles,and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that which wasindeed too surely true. \"alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness ofhis heart, \"why are the achaeans again scouring the plain and flockingtowards the ships? heaven grant the gods be not now bringing thatsorrow upon me of which my mother thetis spoke, saying that while i wasyet alive the bravest of the myrmidons should fall before the trojans,and see the light of the sun no longer. i fear the brave son ofmenoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet i bade him returnto the ships as soon as he had driven back those that were bringingfire against them, and not join battle with hector.\"as he was thus pondering, the son of nestor came up to him and told hissad tale, weeping bitterly the while. \"alas,\" he cried, \"son of noblepeleus, i bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were untrue.patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about his naked body--forhector holds his armour.\"a dark cloud of grief fell upon achilles as he listened. he filled bothhands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,disfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over hisshirt so fair and new. he flung himself down all huge and hugely atfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. the bondswomen whomachilles and patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,beating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.antilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his handsas he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into hisown throat. then achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard him asshe was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of nereus thatdwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. there wereglauce, thalia and cymodoce, nesaia, speo, thoe and dark-eyed halie,cymothoe, actaea and limnorea, melite, iaera, amphithoe and agave, dotoand proto, pherusa and dynamene, dexamene, amphinome and callianeira,doris, panope, and the famous sea-nymph galatea, nemertes, apseudes andcallianassa. there were also clymene, ianeira and ianassa, maera,oreithuia and amatheia of the lovely locks, with other nereids whodwell in the depths of the sea. the crystal cave was filled with theirmultitude and they all beat their breasts while thetis led them intheir lament.\"listen,\" she cried, \"sisters, daughters of nereus, that you may hearthe burden of my sorrows. alas, woe is me, woe in that i have borne themost glorious of offspring. i bore him fair and strong, hero amongheroes, and he shot up as a sapling; i tended him as a plant in agoodly garden, and sent him with his ships to ilius to fight thetrojans, but never shall i welcome him back to the house of peleus. solong as he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is in heaviness,and though i go to him i cannot help him. nevertheless i will go, thati may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallen him though heis still holding aloof from battle.\"she left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weepingafter, and the waves opened a path before them. when they reached therich plain of troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line on tothe sands, at the place where the ships of the myrmidons were drawn upin close order round the tents of achilles. his mother went up to himas he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and spokepiteously, saying, \"my son, why are you thus weeping? what sorrow hasnow befallen you? tell me; hide it not from me. surely jove has grantedyou the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands and besoughthim that the achaeans might all of them be pent up at their ships, andrue it bitterly in that you were no longer with them.\"achilles groaned and answered, \"mother, olympian jove has indeedvouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me,seeing that my dear comrade patroclus has fallen--he whom i valued morethan all others, and loved as dearly as my own life? i have lost him;aye, and hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous armour, soglorious to behold, which the gods gave to peleus when they laid you inthe couch of a mortal man. would that you were still dwelling among theimmortal sea-nymphs, and that peleus had taken to himself some mortalbride. for now you shall have grief infinite by reason of the death ofthat son whom you can never welcome home--nay, i will not live nor goabout among mankind unless hector fall by my spear, and thus pay me forhaving slain patroclus son of menoetius.\"thetis wept and answered, \"then, my son, is your end near at hand--foryour own death awaits you full soon after that of hector.\"then said achilles in his great grief, \"i would die here and now, inthat i could not save my comrade. he has fallen far from home, and inhis hour of need my hand was not there to help him. what is there forme? return to my own land i shall not, and i have brought no savingneither to patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so many have beenslain by mighty hector; i stay here by my ships a bootless burden uponthe earth, i, who in fight have no peer among the achaeans, though incouncil there are better than i. therefore, perish strife both fromamong gods and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous man will hardenhis heart--which rises up in the soul of a man like smoke, and thetaste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. even so has agamemnonangered me. and yet--so be it, for it is over; i will force my soulinto subjection as i needs must; i will go; i will pursue hector whohas slain him whom i loved so dearly, and will then abide my doom whenit may please jove and the other gods to send it. even hercules, thebest beloved of jove--even he could not escape the hand of death, butfate and juno's fierce anger laid him low, as i too shall lie when i amdead if a like doom awaits me. till then i will win fame, and will bidtrojan and dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks withboth their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shallthey know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer.hold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shall notmove me.\"then silver-footed thetis answered, \"my son, what you have said istrue. it is well to save your comrades from destruction, but yourarmour is in the hands of the trojans; hector bears it in triumph uponhis own shoulders. full well i know that his vaunt shall not belasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the pressof battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day ishall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from king vulcan.\"on this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to thesea-nymphs her sisters, \"dive into the bosom of the sea and go to thehouse of the old sea-god my father. tell him everything; as for me, iwill go to the cunning workman vulcan on high olympus, and ask him toprovide my son with a suit of splendid armour.\"when she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves, whilesilver-footed thetis went her way that she might bring the armour forher son.thus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to olympus, and meanwhile theachaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous hector till theyreached the ships and the hellespont, and they could not draw the bodyof mars's servant patroclus out of reach of the weapons that wereshowered upon him, for hector son of priam with his host and horsemenhad again caught up to him like the flame of a fiery furnace; thricedid brave hector seize him by the feet, striving with might and main todraw him away and calling loudly on the trojans, and thrice did the twoajaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him from off thebody; but all undaunted he would now charge into the thick of thefight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud, but he wouldgive no ground. as upland shepherds that cannot chase some famishedlion from a carcase, even so could not the two ajaxes scare hector sonof priam from the body of patroclus.and now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishableglory, had not iris fleet as the wind, winged her way as messenger fromolympus to the son of peleus and bidden him arm. she came secretlywithout the knowledge of jove and of the other gods, for juno sent her,and when she had got close to him she said, \"up, son of peleus,mightiest of all mankind; rescue patroclus about whom this fearfulfight is now raging by the ships. men are killing one another, thedanaans in defence of the dead body, while the trojans are trying tohale it away, and take it to windy ilius: hector is the most furious ofthem all; he is for cutting the head from the body and fixing it on thestakes of the wall. up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink from thethought that patroclus may become meat for the dogs of troy. shame onyou, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.\"and achilles said, \"iris, which of the gods was it that sent you to me?\"iris answered, \"it was juno the royal spouse of jove, but the son ofsaturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of theimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of olympus.\"then fleet achilles answered her saying, \"how can i go up into thebattle? they have my armour. my mother forbade me to arm till i shouldsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from vulcan; iknow no man whose arms i can put on, save only the shield of ajax sonof telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank andwielding his spear about the body of dead patroclus.\"iris said, \"we know that your armour has been taken, but go as you are;go to the deep trench and show yourself before the trojans, that theymay fear you and cease fighting. thus will the fainting sons of theachaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may hardly be.\"iris left him when she had so spoken. but achilles dear to jove arose,and minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong shoulders; shecrowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled aglow of gleaming fire. as the smoke that goes up into heaven from somecity that is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea--all daylong do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at thegoing down of the sun the line of beacon-fires blazes forth, flaringhigh for those that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they maycome with their ships and succour them--even so did the light flarefrom the head of achilles, as he stood by the trench, going beyond thewall--but he did not join the achaeans for he heeded the charge whichhis mother laid upon him.there did he stand and shout aloud. minerva also raised her voice fromafar, and spread terror unspeakable among the trojans. ringing as thenote of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gates of acity, even so brazen was the voice of the son of aeacus, and when thetrojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the horses turnedback with their chariots for they boded mischief, and their driverswere awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyed goddess hadkindled above the head of the great son of peleus.thrice did achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench, andthrice were the trojans and their brave allies thrown into confusion;whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels oftheir chariots and perished by their own spears. the achaeans to theirgreat joy then drew patroclus out of reach of the weapons, and laid himon a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among themfleet achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying deadupon his bier. he had sent him out with horses and chariots intobattle, but his return he was not to welcome.then juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters ofoceanus; so he set, and the achaeans had rest from the tug and turmoilof war.now the trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked theirhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. theykept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallenupon them all because achilles had shown himself after having heldaloof so long from battle. polydamas son of panthous was first tospeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both beforeand after. he was comrade to hector, and they had been born upon thesame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressedthem thus:--\"look to it well, my friends; i would urge you to go back now to yourcity and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are far fromour walls. so long as this man was at enmity with agamemnon theachaeans were easier to deal with, and i would have gladly camped bythe ships in the hope of taking them; but now i go in great fear of thefleet son of peleus; he is so daring that he will never bide here onthe plain whereon the trojans and achaeans fight with equal valour, buthe will try to storm our city and carry off our women. do then as isay, and let us retreat. for this is what will happen. the darkness ofnight will for a time stay the son of peleus, but if he find us here inthe morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall haveknowledge of him in good earnest. glad indeed will he be who can escapeand get back to ilius, and many a trojan will become meat for dogs andvultures may i never live to hear it. if we do as i say, little thoughwe may like it, we shall have strength in counsel during the night, andthe great gates with the doors that close them will protect the city.at dawn we can arm and take our stand on the walls; he will then rue itif he sallies from the ships to fight us. he will go back when he hasgiven his horses their fill of being driven all whithers under ourwalls, and will be in no mind to try and force his way into the city.neither will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.\"hector looked fiercely at him and answered, \"polydamas, your words arenot to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within thecity. have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? in theold-days the city of priam was famous the whole world over for itswealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of ourhouses, and much goods have been sold away to phrygia and fair meonia,for the hand of jove has been laid heavily upon us. now, therefore,that the son of scheming saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here andto hem the achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool'swise among the people. you will have no man with you; it shall not be;do all of you as i now say;--take your suppers in your companiesthroughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful every man ofyou. if any trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let him gather themand give them out among the people. better let these, rather than theachaeans, have them. at daybreak we will arm and fight about the ships;granted that achilles has again come forward to defend them, let it beas he will, but it shall go hard with him. i shall not shun him, butwill fight him, to fall or conquer. the god of war deals out likemeasure to all, and the slayer may yet be slain.\"thus spoke hector; and the trojans, fools that they were, shouted inapplause, for pallas minerva had robbed them of their understanding.they gave ear to hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words ofpolydamas no man would heed. they took their supper throughout thehost, and meanwhile through the whole night the achaeans mournedpatroclus, and the son of peleus led them in their lament. he laid hismurderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again andagain as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed himof his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he isfurious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he canfind him, for he is mad with rage--even so with many a sigh didachilles speak among the myrmidons saying, \"alas! vain were the wordswith which i cheered the hero menoetius in his own house; i said that iwould bring his brave son back again to opoeis after he had sackedilius and taken his share of the spoils--but jove does not give all mentheir heart's desire. the same soil shall be reddened here at troy bythe blood of us both, for i too shall never be welcomed home by the oldknight peleus, nor by my mother thetis, but even in this place shallthe earth cover me. nevertheless, o patroclus, now that i am leftbehind you, i will not bury you, till i have brought hither the headand armour of mighty hector who has slain you. twelve noble sons oftrojans will i behead before your bier to avenge you; till i have doneso you shall lie as you are by the ships, and fair women of troy anddardanus, whom we have taken with spear and strength of arm when wesacked men's goodly cities, shall weep over you both night and day.\"then achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire thatthey might wash the clotted gore from off patroclus. thereon they set atripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks on toit to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played aboutthe belly of the tripod. when the water in the cauldron was boilingthey washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its wounds withointment that had been kept nine years. then they laid it on a bier andcovered it with a linen cloth from head to foot, and over this theylaid a fair white robe. thus all night long did the myrmidons gatherround achilles to mourn patroclus.then jove said to juno his sister-wife, \"so, queen juno, you havegained your end, and have roused fleet achilles. one would think thatthe achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.\"and juno answered, \"dread son of saturn, why should you say this thing?may not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we do, dowhat he can for another person? and shall not i--foremost of allgoddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign inheaven--devise evil for the trojans if i am angry with them?\"thus did they converse. meanwhile thetis came to the house of vulcan,imperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in heaven, a houseof bronze wrought by the lame god's own hands. she found him busy withhis bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making twentytripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, and he set wheelsof gold under them all that they might go of their own selves to theassemblies of the gods, and come back again--marvels indeed to see.they were finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship which yetremained to be fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and he washammering at the rivets. while he was thus at work silver-footed thetiscame to the house. charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to thefar-famed lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and tookher hand in her own, saying, \"why have you come to our house, thetis,honoured and ever welcome--for you do not visit us often? come insideand let me set refreshment before you.\"the goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade thetis sit on a richlydecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under herfeet. then she called vulcan and said, \"vulcan, come here, thetis wantsyou\"; and the far-famed lame god answered, \"then it is indeed an augustand honoured goddess who has come here; she it was that took care of mewhen i was suffering from the heavy fall which i had through my cruelmother's anger--for she would have got rid of me because i was lame. itwould have gone hardly with me had not eurynome, daughter of theever-encircling waters of oceanus, and thetis, taken me to their bosom.nine years did i stay with them, and many beautiful works in bronze,brooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did i make for them intheir cave, with the roaring waters of oceanus foaming as they rushedever past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor men, save onlythetis and eurynome who took care of me. if, then, thetis has come tomy house i must make her due requital for having saved me; entertainher, therefore, with all hospitality, while i put by my bellows and allmy tools.\"on this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legsplying lustily under him. he set the bellows away from the fire, andgathered his tools into a silver chest. then he took a sponge andwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donnedhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door. therewere golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like real youngwomen, with sense and reason, voice also and strength, and all thelearning of the immortals; these busied themselves as the king badethem, while he drew near to thetis, seated her upon a goodly seat, andtook her hand in his own, saying, \"why have you come to our house,thetis honoured and ever welcome--for you do not visit us often? saywhat you want, and i will do it for you at once if i can, and if it canbe done at all.\"thetis wept and answered, \"vulcan, is there another goddess in olympuswhom the son of saturn has been pleased to try with so much afflictionas he has me? me alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject to amortal husband, peleus son of aeacus, and sorely against my will did isubmit to the embraces of one who was but mortal, and who now stays athome worn out with age. neither is this all. heaven vouchsafed me ason, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling. i tended him as aplant in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships to ilius to fightthe trojans, but never shall i welcome him back to the house of peleus.so long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun, he is inheaviness, and though i go to him i cannot help him; king agamemnon hasmade him give up the maiden whom the sons of the achaeans had awardedhim, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake. then the trojans hemmedthe achaeans in at their ships' sterns and would not let them comeforth; the elders, therefore, of the argives besought achilles andoffered him great treasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance tothem himself, but put his own armour on patroclus and sent him into thefight with much people after him. all day long they fought by thescaean gates and would have taken the city there and then, had notapollo vouchsafed glory to hector and slain the valiant son ofmenoetius after he had done the trojans much evil. therefore i amsuppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son,whose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greavesfitted with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his ownwhen his true comrade fell at the hands of the trojans, and he now liesstretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.\"and vulcan answered, \"take heart, and be no more disquieted about thismatter; would that i could hide him from death's sight when his hour iscome, so surely as i can find him armour that shall amaze the eyes ofall who behold it.\"when he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning themtowards the fire and bidding them do their office. twenty bellows blewupon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some fierceto help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as vulcanwilled it in the course of his work. he threw tough copper into thefire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on itsblock, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took thetongs in the other.first he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all overand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and thebaldric was made of silver. he made the shield in five thicknesses, andwith many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.he wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at herfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face ofheaven--the pleiads, the hyads, huge orion, and the bear, which menalso call the wain and which turns round ever in one place, facingorion, and alone never dips into the stream of oceanus.he wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of men.in the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were going aboutthe city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from theirchambers. loud rose the cry of hymen, and the youths danced to themusic of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house doorto see them.meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was aquarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man whohad been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paiddamages in full, and the other that he had not been paid. each wastrying to make his own case good, and the people took sides, each manbacking the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, andthe elders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding thestaves which the heralds had put into their hands. then they rose andeach in his turn gave judgement, and there were two talents laid down,to be given to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.about the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour,and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and accept thehalf of what it contained. but the men of the city would not yetconsent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and littlechildren kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who werepast fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with mars andpallas minerva at their head--both of them wrought in gold and clad ingolden raiment, great and fair with their armour as befitting gods,while they that followed were smaller. when they reached the placewhere they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which livestock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here, then,they lay concealed, clad in full armour. some way off them there weretwo scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or cattle,which presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing ontheir pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. when those whowere in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and killedthe shepherds. meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much noiseamong the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses, andmade with all speed towards them; when they reached them they setbattle in array by the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed theirbronze-shod spears at one another. with them were strife and riot, andfell fate who was dragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound,and the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragginghim along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men's blood. theywent in and out with one another and fought as though they were livingpeople haling away one another's dead.he wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already.many men were working at the plough within it, turning their oxen toand fro, furrow after furrow. each time that they turned on reachingthe headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,and they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the timewhen they should again reach the headland. the part that they hadploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it was ofgold, still looked as if it were being ploughed--very curious to behold.he wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reapingwith sharp sickles in their hands. swathe after swathe fell to theground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them inbands of twisted straw. there were three binders, and behind them therewere boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept on bringingthem to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by insilence and was glad. the servants were getting a meal ready under anoak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting him up,while the women were making a porridge of much white barley for thelabourers' dinner.he wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines wereloaded with grapes. the bunches overhead were black, but the vines weretrained on poles of silver. he ran a ditch of dark metal all round it,and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one path to it, andby this the vintagers went when they would gather the vintage. youthsand maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried the luscious fruit inplaited baskets; and with them there went a boy who made sweet musicwith his lyre, and sang the linos-song with his clear boyish voice.he wrought also a herd of horned cattle. he made the cows of gold andtin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go andfeed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. alongwith the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, andtheir nine fleet dogs went with them. two terrible lions had fastenedon a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as hemight they haled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions torethrough the bull's thick hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels,but the herdsmen were afraid to do anything, and only hounded on theirdogs; the dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by barking andkeeping out of harm's way.the god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and a largeflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.furthermore he wrought a green, like that which daedalus once made incnossus for lovely ariadne. hereon there danced youths and maidens whomall would woo, with their hands on one another's wrists. the maidenswore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that wereslightly oiled. the girls were crowned with garlands, while the youngmen had daggers of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes theywould dance deftly in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it were apotter sitting at his work and making trial of his wheel to see whetherit will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with one another,and much people was gathered joyously about the green. there was a bardalso to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went aboutperforming in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.all round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream ofthe river oceanus.then when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made abreastplate also that shone brighter than fire. he made a helmet, closefitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume overhangingit; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.lastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took it andset it before the mother of achilles; whereon she darted like a falconfrom the snowy summits of olympus and bore away the gleaming armourfrom the house of vulcan.book xix  achilles is reconciled with agamemnon, puts on the armour  which vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.now when dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams ofoceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, thetis reached theships with the armour that the god had given her. she found her sonfallen about the body of patroclus and weeping bitterly. many also ofhis followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came amongthem she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"my son, grieve as we maywe must let this man lie, for it is by heaven's will that he hasfallen; now, therefore, accept from vulcan this rich and goodly armour,which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"as she spoke she set the armour before achilles, and it rang outbravely as she did so. the myrmidons were struck with awe, and nonedared look full at it, for they were afraid; but achilles was roused tostill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for hewas glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had madehim. then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, hesaid to his mother, \"mother, the god has given me armour, meethandiwork for an immortal and such as no-one living could havefashioned; i will now arm, but i much fear that flies will settle uponthe son of menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that hisbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\"silver-footed thetis answered, \"my son, be not disquieted about thismatter. i will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisomeflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. hemay lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound asever, or even sounder. call, therefore, the achaean heroes in assembly;unsay your anger against agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with mightand main.\"as she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she thendropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of patroclus, that hisbody might suffer no change.then achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called onthe achaean heroes. on this even those who as yet had stayed always atthe ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who wereabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place ofassembly because achilles had shown himself after having held aloof solong from fighting. two sons of mars, ulysses and the son of tydeus,came limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless theycame, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. last ofall came agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for coon son ofantenor had struck him with a spear in battle.when the achaeans were got together achilles rose and said, \"son ofatreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,when we two were in such high anger about briseis, surely it would havebeen better, had diana's arrow slain her at the ships on the day when itook her after having sacked lyrnessus. for so, many an achaean theless would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. ithas been well for hector and the trojans, but the achaeans will longindeed remember our quarrel. now, however, let it be, for it is over.if we have been angry, necessity has schooled our anger. i put it fromme: i dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the achaeans armforthwith that i may go out against the trojans, and learn whether theywill be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. glad, i ween, will he beto rest his knees who may fly my spear when i wield it.\"thus did he speak, and the achaeans rejoiced in that he had put awayhis anger.then agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into themiddle of the assembly. \"danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of mars, itis well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemlyto interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. whocan either hear or speak in an uproar? even the finest orator will bedisconcerted by it. i will expound to the son of peleus, and do youother achaeans heed me and mark me well. often have the achaeans spokento me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not i that did it:jove, and fate, and erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when wewere assembled on the day that i took from achilles the meed that hadbeen awarded to him. what could i do? all things are in the hand ofheaven, and folly, eldest of jove's daughters, shuts men's eyes totheir destruction. she walks delicately, not on the solid earth, buthovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.\"time was when she fooled jove himself, who they say is greatestwhether of gods or men; for juno, woman though she was, beguiled him onthe day when alcmena was to bring forth mighty hercules in the faircity of thebes. he told it out among the gods saying, 'hear me, allgods and goddesses, that i may speak even as i am minded; this dayshall an ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man childinto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who areof my blood and lineage.' then said juno all crafty and full of guile,'you will play false, and will not hold to your word. swear me, oolympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day fallbetween the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell abouthim who are of your blood and lineage.'\"thus she spoke, and jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,to his much ruing thereafter. for juno darted down from the high summitof olympus, and went in haste to achaean argos where she knew that thenoble wife of sthenelus son of perseus then was. she being with childand in her seventh month, juno brought the child to birth though therewas a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of alcmena, andkept back the ilithuiae. then she went to tell jove the son of saturn,and said, 'father jove, lord of the lightning--i have a word for yourear. there is a fine child born this day, eurystheus, son to sthenelusthe son of perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, thathe should reign over the argives.'\"on this jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caughtfolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she againinvade starry heaven and olympus, for she was the bane of all. then hewhirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down fromheaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was everangry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel laboursthat eurystheus laid upon him. even so did i grieve when mighty hectorwas killing the argives at their ships, and all the time i keptthinking of folly who had so baned me. i was blind, and jove robbed meof my reason; i will now make atonement, and will add much treasure byway of amends. go, therefore, into battle, you and your people withyou. i will give you all that ulysses offered you yesterday in yourtents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight atonce, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you maysee whether what i give you is enough.\"and achilles answered, \"son of atreus, king of men agamemnon, you cangive such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is inyour own hands. let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarrytalking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do.achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and layinglow the ranks of the trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when heis fighting.\"then ulysses said, \"achilles, godlike and brave, send not the achaeansthus against ilius to fight the trojans fasting, for the battle will beno brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sideswith fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships,for in this there is strength and stay. no man can do battle thelivelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;however much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before heknows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will growweary under him. but a man can fight all day if he is full fed withmeat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till hehas routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid themprepare their meal; king agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presenceof the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied.moreover let him swear an oath before the argives that he has nevergone up into the couch of briseis, nor been with her after the mannerof men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind;let agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast ofreconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. as for you,son of atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is nodisgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong inthe first instance.\"and king agamemnon answered, \"son of laertes, your words please mewell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. i will swear as you wouldhave me do; i do so of my own free will, neither shall i take the nameof heaven in vain. let, then, achilles wait, though he would fain fightat once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tentand we ratify the oath with sacrifice. thus, then, do i charge you:take some noble young achaeans with you, and bring from my tents thegifts that i promised yesterday to achilles, and bring the women also;furthermore let talthybius find me a boar from those that are with thehost, and make it ready for sacrifice to jove and to the sun.\"then said achilles, \"son of atreus, king of men agamemnon, see to thesematters at some other season, when there is breathing time and when iam calmer. would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom hectorson of priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? let the sonsof the achaeans, say i, fight fasting and without food, till we haveavenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eattheir fill. as for me, patroclus is lying dead in my tent, all hackedand hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourninground him. therefore i can take thought of nothing save only slaughterand blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"ulysses answered, \"achilles, son of peleus, mightiest of all theachaeans, in battle you are better than i, and that more than a little,but in counsel i am much before you, for i am older and of greaterknowledge. therefore be patient under my words. fighting is a thing ofwhich men soon surfeit, and when jove, who is war's steward, weighs theupshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reapedis far heavier than the grain. it may not be that the achaeans shouldmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick andthreefold continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? letus mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, butlet those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fightour foes more fiercely. in that hour let no man hold back, waiting fora second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is foundlagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loosethe fury of war upon the trojans.\"when he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of nestor, with megesson of phyleus, thoas, meriones, lycomedes son of creontes, andmelanippus, and went to the tent of agamemnon son of atreus. the wordwas not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seventripods which agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal cauldronsand the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in usefularts, seven in number, with briseis, which made eight. ulysses weighedout the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while the youngachaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in the middle ofthe assembly.agamemnon then rose, and talthybius whose voice was like that of a godcame to him with the boar. the son of atreus drew the knife which hewore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off somebristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so.the other achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hearthe king, and agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayedsaying, \"i call jove the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, icall also earth and sun and the erinyes who dwell below and takevengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that i have laid no hand uponthe girl briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but thatshe has remained in my tents inviolate. if i swear falsely may heavenvisit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who perjurethemselves.\"he cut the boar's throat as he spoke, whereon talthybius whirled itround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. thenachilles also rose and said to the argives, \"father jove, of a truthyou blind men's eyes and bane them. the son of atreus had not elsestirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken briseis fromme against my will. surely jove must have counselled the destruction ofmany an argive. go, now, and take your food that we may begin fighting.\"on this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his ownship. the myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to theship of achilles. they placed them in his tents, while the stable-mendrove the horses in among the others.briseis, fair as venus, when she saw the mangled body of patroclus,flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,and her lovely face with both her hands. beautiful as a goddess shewept and said, \"patroclus, dearest friend, when i went hence i left youliving; i return, o prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrowsmultiply upon me one after the other. i saw him to whom my father andmother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dearbrothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, patroclus,even when achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble mynes,told me that i was not to weep, for you said you would make achillesmarry me, and take me back with him to phthia, we should have a weddingfeast among the myrmidons. you were always kind to me and i shall nevercease to grieve for you.\"she wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making asthough their tears were for patroclus, but in truth each was weepingfor her own sorrows. the elders of the achaeans gathered round achillesand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"ipray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eatnor drink, for i am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even tothe going down of the sun.\"on this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons ofatreus and ulysses, nestor, idomeneus, and the knight phoenix, whostayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:but he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself intothe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever ofpatroclus. then he said--\"hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinnerready for me at once and without delay when the achaeans were hastingto fight the trojans; now, therefore, though i have meat and drink inmy tents, yet will i fast for sorrow. grief greater than this i couldnot know, not even though i were to hear of the death of my father, whois now in phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who am herefighting the trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake of helen,nor yet though i should hear that my son is no more--he who is beingbrought up in scyros--if indeed neoptolemus is still living. till now imade sure that i alone was to fall here at troy away from argos, whileyou were to return to phthia, bring back my son with you in your ownship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the greatness ofmy house--for peleus must surely be either dead, or what little liferemains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and everpresent fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my death.\"he wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thoughton what he had left at home behind him. the son of saturn looked downwith pity upon them, and said presently to minerva, \"my child, you havequite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of yourrecollection? there he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss ofhis dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner hewill neither eat nor drink. go then and drop nectar and ambrosia intohis breast, that he may know no hunger.\"with these words he urged minerva, who was already of the same mind.she darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing onhis broad wings and screaming. meanwhile the achaeans were armingthroughout the host, and when minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosiainto achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to failhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. thick as thechill snow-flakes shed from the hand of jove and borne on the keenblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets, thebossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen spearsstream from the ships. the sheen pierced the sky, the whole land wasradiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of theirtreading rose from under their feet. in the midst of them all achillesput on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,for his grief was greater than he could bear. thus, then, full of furyagainst the trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the armour thatvulcan had made him.first he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and nexthe did on the breastplate about his chest. he slung the silver-studdedsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield sogreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. asthe light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a fire intheir homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors arecarried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where theywould be--even so did the gleam of achilles' wondrous shield strike upinto the heavens. he lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon hishead, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes whichvulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all aroundit. then achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether itfitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemedto buoy him up as though it had been wings.he also drew his father's spear out of the spear-stand, a spear sogreat and heavy and strong that none of the achaeans save only achilleshad strength to wield it; this was the spear of pelian ash from thetopmost ridges of mt. pelion, which chiron had once given to peleus,fraught with the death of heroes. automedon and alcimus busiedthemselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fastabout them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins backtowards the chariot. automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind thehorses, and after him achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent asthe sun-god hyperion. then with a loud voice he chided with hisfather's horses saying, \"xanthus and balius, famed offspring ofpodarge--this time when we have done fighting be sure and bring yourdriver safely back to the host of the achaeans, and do not leave himdead on the plain as you did patroclus.\"then fleet xanthus answered under the yoke--for white-armed juno hadendowed him with human speech--and he bowed his head till his manetouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"dreadachilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of yourdeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heavenand stern fate that will destroy you. neither was it through any slothor slackness on our part that the trojans stripped patroclus of hisarmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely leto bore that slew him as hefought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to hector. we twocan fly as swiftly as zephyrus who they say is fleetest of all winds;nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.\"when he had thus said the erinyes stayed his speech, and achillesanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"why, o xanthus, do you thusforetell my death? you need not do so, for i well know that i am tofall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,shall i stay my hand till i have given the trojans their fill offighting.\"so saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.book xx  the gods hold a council and determine to watch the fight, from  the hill callicolone, and the barrow of hercules--a fight  between achilles and aeneas is interrupted by neptune, who  saves aeneas--achilles kills many trojans.thus, then, did the achaeans arm by their ships round you, o son ofpeleus, who were hungering for battle; while the trojans over againstthem armed upon the rise of the plain.meanwhile jove from the top of many-delled olympus, bade themis gatherthe gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to thehouse of jove. there was not a river absent except oceanus, nor asingle one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of riversand meadows of green grass. when they reached the house ofcloud-compelling jove, they took their seats in the arcades of polishedmarble which vulcan with his consummate skill had made for father jove.in such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of jove. neptunealso, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and cameup out of the sea to join them. there, sitting in the midst of them, heasked what jove's purpose might be. \"why,\" said he, \"wielder of thelightning, have you called the gods in council? are you consideringsome matter that concerns the trojans and achaeans--for the blaze ofbattle is on the point of being kindled between them?\"and jove answered, \"you know my purpose, shaker of earth, and whereforei have called you hither. i take thought for them even in theirdestruction. for my own part i shall stay here seated on mt. olympusand look on in peace, but do you others go about among trojans andachaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed. ifachilles fights the trojans without hindrance they will make no standagainst him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now thathe is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will override fateitself and storm their city.\"thus spoke jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took theirseveral sides and went into battle. juno, pallas minerva,earth-encircling neptune, mercury bringer of good luck and excellent inall cunning--all these joined the host that came from the ships; withthem also came vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thinlegs plying lustily under him. mars of gleaming helmet joined thetrojans, and with him apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer goddessdiana, leto, xanthus, and laughter-loving venus.so long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors theachaeans were triumphant, for achilles who had long refused to fightwas now with them. there was not a trojan but his limbs failed him forfear as he beheld the fleet son of peleus all glorious in his armour,and looking like mars himself. when, however, the olympians came totake their part among men, forthwith uprose strong strife, rouser ofhosts, and minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by the deeptrench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all her mightupon the shore of the sounding sea. mars also bellowed out upon theother side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on the trojansat the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now speeding upthe side of the river simois till he came to the hill callicolone.thus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fiercecontention also among themselves. the sire of gods and men thunderedfrom heaven above, while from beneath neptune shook the vast earth, andbade the high hills tremble. the spurs and crests of many-fountainedida quaked, as also the city of the trojans and the ships of theachaeans. hades, king of the realms below, was struck with fear; hesprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud in terror lestneptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the ground over his head,and lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight of mortals andimmortals--mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods shudder to thinkof them. such was the uproar as the gods came together in battle.apollo with his arrows took his stand to face king neptune, whileminerva took hers against the god of war; the archer-goddess diana withher golden arrows, sister of far-darting apollo, stood to face juno;mercury the lusty bringer of good luck faced leto, while the mightyeddying river whom men can scamander, but gods xanthus, matched himselfagainst vulcan.the gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. but the heart ofachilles was set on meeting hector son of priam, for it was with hisblood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn lord ofbattle. meanwhile apollo set aeneas on to attack the son of peleus, andput courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of lycaon son ofpriam. in his likeness therefore, he said to aeneas, \"aeneas,counsellor of the trojans, where are now the brave words with which youvaunted over your wine before the trojan princes, saying that you wouldfight achilles son of peleus in single combat?\"and aeneas answered, \"why do you thus bid me fight the proud son ofpeleus, when i am in no mind to do so? were i to face him now, it wouldnot be for the first time. his spear has already put me to flight fromida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked lyrnessus and pedasus; joveindeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else had ifallen by the hands of achilles and minerva, who went before him toprotect him and urged him to fall upon the lelegae and trojans. no manmay fight achilles, for one of the gods is always with him as hisguardian angel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies everstraight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against him;if heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not soonovercome me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze.\"then said king apollo, son to jove, \"nay, hero, pray to the ever-livinggods, for men say that you were born of jove's daughter venus, whereasachilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. venus is child to jove,while thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. bring,therefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you withhis taunts and menaces.\"as he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of hispeople, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremostfighters. nor did the son of anchises escape the notice of white-armedjuno, as he went forth into the throng to meet achilles. she called thegods about her, and said, \"look to it, you two, neptune and minerva,and consider how this shall be; phoebus apollo has been sending aeneasclad in full armour to fight achilles. shall we turn him back at once,or shall one of us stand by achilles and endow him with strength sothat his heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of theimmortals are on his side, while the others who have all along beendefending the trojans are but vain helpers? let us all come down fromolympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at thehands of the trojans. hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may havespun out for him when he was begotten and his mother bore him. ifachilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come to fearpresently when one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terribleif they are seen face to face.\"neptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, \"juno, restrainyour fury; it is not well; i am not in favour of forcing the other godsto fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side; let ustake our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let mortalsfight it out among themselves. if mars or phoebus apollo beginfighting, or keep achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too,will at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soonleave the field and go back vanquished to olympus among the other gods.\"with these words the dark-haired god led the way to the highearth-barrow of hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by thetrojans and pallas minerva for him to fly to when the sea-monster waschasing him from the shore on to the plain. here neptune and those thatwere with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness;but the other gods seated themselves on the brow of callicolone roundyou, o phoebus, and mars the waster of cities.thus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side waswilling to begin battle with the other, and jove from his seat on highwas in command over them all. meanwhile the whole plain was alive withmen and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. the earth rangagain under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards each other,and two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between thehosts to fight--to wit, aeneas son of anchises, and noble achilles.aeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmettossing defiance as he came on. he held his strong shield before hisbreast, and brandished his bronze spear. the son of peleus from theother side sprang forth to meet him, like some fierce lion that thewhole country-side has met to hunt and kill--at first he bodes no ill,but when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouchesopenmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail fromside to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springsstraight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slainamong the foremost of his foes--even with such fury did achilles burnto spring upon aeneas.when they were now close up with one another achilles was first tospeak. \"aeneas,\" said he, \"why do you stand thus out before the host tofight me? is it that you hope to reign over the trojans in the seat ofpriam? nay, though you kill me priam will not hand his kingdom over toyou. he is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. orhave the trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness, fairwith orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? this youshall hardly do. i have discomfited you once already. have youforgotten how when you were alone i chased you from your herdshelter-skelter down the slopes of ida? you did not turn round to lookbehind you; you took refuge in lyrnessus, but i attacked the city, andwith the help of minerva and father jove i sacked it and carried itswomen into captivity, though jove and the other gods rescued you. youthink they will protect you now, but they will not do so; therefore isay go back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it. evena fool may be wise after the event.\"then aeneas answered, \"son of peleus, think not that your words canscare me as though i were a child. i too, if i will, can brag and talkunseemly. we know one another's race and parentage as matters of commonfame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor i yours. men saythat you are son to noble peleus, and that your mother is thetis,fair-haired daughter of the sea. i have noble anchises for my father,and venus for my mother; the parents of one or other of us shall thisday mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk that shall part uswhen the fight is over. learn, then, my lineage if you will--and it isknown to many.\"in the beginning dardanus was the son of jove, and founded dardania,for ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in, andher people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained ida. dardanushad a son, king erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living; hehad three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and theirfoals with them. boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, andcovered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. twelve fillyfoals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over therich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn and notbreak them; or again when they would disport themselves on the broadback of ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. erichthoniusbegat tros, king of the trojans, and tros had three noble sons, ilus,assaracus, and ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore thegods carried him off to be jove's cupbearer, for his beauty's sake,that he might dwell among the immortals. ilus begat laomedon, andlaomedon begat tithonus, priam, lampus, clytius, and hiketaon of thestock of mars. but assaracus was father to capys, and capys toanchises, who was my father, while hector is son to priam.\"such do i declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, jove givesit or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. and now let there beno more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children. wecould fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared galleywould not hold them. the tongue can run all whithers and talk all wise;it can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he be gainsaid.what is the use of our bandying hard like women who when they fall foulof one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and theother lies, as rage inspires them? no words of yours shall turn me nowthat i am fain to fight--therefore let us make trial of one anotherwith our spears.\"as he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield ofachilles, which rang out as the point struck it. the son of peleus heldthe shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid, for hedeemed that aeneas's spear would go through it quite easily, notreflecting that the god's glorious gifts were little likely to yieldbefore the blows of mortal men; and indeed aeneas's spear did notpierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed thepoint. it went through two layers, but the god had made the shield infive, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and one of gold; itwas in this that the spear was stayed.achilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of aeneas atthe very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of pelian ashwent clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; aeneas wasafraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him; thespear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the ground,after having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield. aeneasthough he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with fear andgrief because the weapon had gone so near him; then achilles sprangfuriously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen bladedrawn, and aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men, as mennow are, would be unable to lift it, but aeneas wielded it quite easily.aeneas would then have struck achilles as he was springing towards him,either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and achilleswould have closed with him and despatched him with his sword, had notneptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said forthwithto the immortals, \"alas, i am sorry for great aeneas, who will now godown to the house of hades, vanquished by the son of peleus. fool thathe was to give ear to the counsel of apollo. apollo will never save himfrom destruction. why should this man suffer when he is guiltless, tono purpose, and in another's quarrel? has he not at all times offeredacceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in heaven? let us thensnatch him from death's jaws, lest the son of saturn be angry shouldachilles slay him. it is fated, moreover, that he should escape, andthat the race of dardanus, whom jove loved above all the sons born tohim of mortal women, shall not perish utterly without seed or sign. fornow indeed has jove hated the blood of priam, while aeneas shall reignover the trojans, he and his children's children that shall be bornhereafter.\"then answered juno, \"earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, andconsider concerning aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him,brave though he be, to fall by the hand of achilles son of peleus. forof a truth we two, i and pallas minerva, have sworn full many a timebefore all the immortals, that never would we shield trojans fromdestruction, not even when all troy is burning in the flames that theachaeans shall kindle.\"when earth-encircling neptune heard this he went into the battle amidthe clash of spears, and came to the place where achilles and aeneaswere. forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son ofpeleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of aeneas,and laid it at the feet of achilles. then he lifted aeneas on high fromoff the earth and hurried him away. over the heads of many a band ofwarriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god's hand sped him,till he came to the very fringe of the battle where the cauconians werearming themselves for fight. neptune, shaker of the earth, then camenear to him and said, \"aeneas, what god has egged you on to this follyin fighting the son of peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour andmore beloved of heaven than you are? give way before him whensoever youmeet him, lest you go down to the house of hades even though fate wouldhave it otherwise. when achilles is dead you may then fight among theforemost undaunted, for none other of the achaeans shall slay you.\"the god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at onceremoved the darkness from before the eyes of achilles, who opened themwide indeed and said in great anger, \"alas! what marvel am i nowbeholding? here is my spear upon the ground, but i see not him whom imeant to kill when i hurled it. of a truth aeneas also must be underheaven's protection, although i had thought his boasting was idle. lethim go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further, seeing hownarrowly he has missed being killed. i will now give my orders to thedanaans and attack some other of the trojans.\"he sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did so.\"let not the trojans,\" he cried, \"keep you at arm's length, achaeans,but go for them and fight them man for man. however valiant i may be, icannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. even mars, who isan immortal, or minerva, would shrink from flinging himself into thejaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, so far as inme lies i will show no slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance,not even for a moment; i will utterly break their ranks, and woe to thetrojan who shall venture within reach of my spear.\"thus did he exhort them. meanwhile hector called upon the trojans anddeclared that he would fight achilles. \"be not afraid, proud trojans,\"said he, \"to face the son of peleus; i could fight gods myself if thebattle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match forme, if we had to use our spears. even so the deed of achilles will fallsomewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the other part hewill clip short. i will go up against him though his hands be asfire--though his hands be fire and his strength iron.\"thus urged the trojans lifted up their spears against the achaeans, andraised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst oftheir ranks. but phoebus apollo came up to hector and said, \"hector, onno account must you challenge achilles to single combat; keep a lookoutfor him while you are under cover of the others and away from the thickof the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut youdown at close quarters.\"thus he spoke, and hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraidwhen he heard what the god had said to him. achilles then sprang uponthe trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment.first he killed iphition son of otrynteus, a leader of much people whoma naiad nymph had borne to otrynteus waster of cities, in the land ofhyde under the snowy heights of mt. tmolus. achilles struck him full onthe head as he was coming on towards him, and split it clean in two;whereon he fell heavily to the ground and achilles vaunted over himsaying, \"you be low, son of otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here,but your lineage is on the gygaean lake where your father's estatelies, by hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of hermus.\"thus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. thechariots of the achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him inthe front of the battle, and after him achilles killed demoleon, avaliant man of war and son to antenor. he struck him on the templethrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. the helmet did not stay the spear,but it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside wasshed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. then hestruck hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from hischariot in front of him, and trying to escape. he breathed his last,bellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to offerhim in sacrifice to the king of helice, and the heart of theearth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. achillesthen went in pursuit of polydorus son of priam, whom his father hadalways forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of his sons, theone he loved best, and the fastest runner. he, in his folly and showingoff the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranksuntil he lost his life, for achilles struck him in the middle of theback as he was darting past him: he struck him just at the goldenfastenings of his belt and where the two pieces of the doublebreastplate overlapped. the point of the spear pierced him through andcame out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and acloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails inhis hands.when hector saw his brother polydorus with his entrails in his handsand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and hecould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised hisspear and darted towards achilles like a flame of fire. when achillessaw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \"this is he that haswounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. not forlong shall we two quail before one another on the highways of war.\"he looked fiercely on hector and said, \"draw near, that you may meetyour doom the sooner.\" hector feared him not and answered, \"son ofpeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though i were achild; i too if i will can brag and talk unseemly; i know that you area mighty warrior, mightier by far than i, nevertheless the issue liesin the lap of heaven whether i, worse man though i be, may not slay youwith my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.\"he hurled his spear as he spoke, but minerva breathed upon it, andthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from goingtowards achilles, so that it returned to hector and lay at his feet infront of him. achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,bent on killing him, but apollo caught him up easily as a god can, andhid him in a thick darkness. thrice did achilles spring towards himspear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. when herushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, he shoutedaloud saying, \"hound, this time too you have escaped death--but of atruth it came exceedingly near you. phoebus apollo, to whom it seemsyou pray before you go into battle, has again saved you; but if i toohave any friend among the gods i will surely make an end of you when icome across you at some other time. now, however, i will pursue andovertake other trojans.\"on this he struck dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck,and he fell headlong at his feet. there he let him lie and stayeddemouchus son of philetor, a man both brave and of great stature, byhitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his swordand killed him. after this he sprang on laogonus and dardanus, sons ofbias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow from athrown spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight. therewas also tros the son of alastor--he came up to achilles and claspedhis knees in the hope that he would spare him and not kill him but lethim go, because they were both of the same age. fool, he might haveknown that he should not prevail with him, for the man was in no moodfor pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. therefore when troslaid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, achillesdrove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out, whilehis bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled from thewound. thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.achilles then went up to mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear,and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. he alsostruck echeclus son of agenor on the head with his sword, which becamewarm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes ofecheclus. next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded deucalionin the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon hewaited achilles' onset with his arm hanging down and death staring himin the face. achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword andflung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing outof his backbone as he lay. he then went in pursuit of rhigmus, nobleson of peires, who had come from fertile thrace, and struck him throughthe middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that hefell headlong from his chariot. he also speared areithous squire torhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight, and thrusthim from his chariot, while the horses were struck with panic.as a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought--and thedense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues offire in every direction--even so furiously did achilles rage, wieldinghis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom hewould slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. or as one who yokesbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor--andit is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle--even sodid the horses of achilles trample on the shields and bodies of theslain. the axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car werebespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses' hoofs, andfrom the tyres of the wheels; but the son of peleus pressed on to winstill further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.book xxi  the fight between achilles and the river scamander--the gods  fight among themselves--achilles drives the trojans within  their gates.now when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river xanthus,begotten of immortal jove, achilles cut their forces in two: one halfhe chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that theachaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day withhector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and juno sentdown a thick mist in front of them to stay them. the other half werehemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into it with agreat uproar. the waters resounded, and the banks rang again, as theyswam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirling eddies. aslocusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire--the flamecomes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they huddle into thewater--even so was the eddying stream of xanthus filled with the uproarof men and horses, all struggling in confusion before achilles.forthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it against atamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god, armed with hissword only. fell was his purpose as he hewed the trojans down on everyside. their dying groans rose hideous as the sword smote them, and theriver ran red with blood. as when fish fly scared before a hugedolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven--for he issure to eat all he can catch--even so did the trojans cower under thebanks of the mighty river, and when achilles' arms grew weary withkilling them, he drew twelve youths alive out of the water, tosacrifice in revenge for patroclus son of menoetius. he drew them outlike dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles oftheir own shirts, and gave them over to his men to take back to theships. then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still further blood.there he found lycaon, son of priam seed of dardanus, as he wasescaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisonerwhen he was in his father's vineyard, having set upon him by night, ashe was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wickersides of a chariot. achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares,and sent him by sea to lemnos, where the son of jason bought him. but aguest-friend, eetion of imbros, freed him with a great sum, and senthim to arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his father'shouse. he had spent eleven days happily with his friends after he hadcome from lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again delivered him intothe hands of achilles, who was to send him to the house of hades sorelyagainst his will. he was unarmed when achilles caught sight of him, andhad neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear, for he hadthrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was sweating withhis struggles to get out of the river, so that his strength was nowfailing him.then achilles said to himself in his surprise, \"what marvel do i seehere? if this man can come back alive after having been sold over intolemnos, i shall have the trojans also whom i have slain rising from theworld below. could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison him, asthey do many another whether he will or no? this time let him taste myspear, that i may know for certain whether mother earth who can keepeven a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or whether thence toohe will return.\"thus did he pause and ponder. but lycaon came up to him dazed andtrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.achilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but lycaonran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passedover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was forblood. with one hand he caught achilles' knees as he besought him, andwith the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go. then hesaid, \"achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for i am yoursuppliant. it was in your tents that i first broke bread on the daywhen you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold me awayto lemnos far from my father and my friends, and i brought you theprice of a hundred oxen. i have paid three times as much to gain myfreedom; it is but twelve days that i have come to ilius after muchsuffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.surely father jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you asecond time. short of life indeed did my mother laothoe bear me,daughter of aged altes--of altes who reigns over the warlike lelegaeand holds steep pedasus on the river satnioeis. priam married hisdaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,both of whom you will have slain. your spear slew noble polydorus as hewas fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall me, fori fear that i shall not escape you since heaven has delivered me overto you. furthermore i say, and lay my saying to your heart, spare me,for i am not of the same womb as hector who slew your brave and noblecomrade.\"with such words did the princely son of priam beseech achilles; butachilles answered him sternly. \"idiot,\" said he, \"talk not to me ofransom. until patroclus fell i preferred to give the trojans quarter,and sold beyond the sea many of those whom i had taken alive; but nownot a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands beforethe city of ilius--and of all trojans it shall fare hardest with thesons of priam. therefore, my friend, you too shall die. why should youwhine in this way? patroclus fell, and he was a better man than youare. i too--see you not how i am great and goodly? i am son to a noblefather, and have a goddess for my mother, but the hands of doom anddeath overshadow me all as surely. the day will come, either at dawn ordark, or at the noontide, when one shall take my life also in battle,either with his spear, or with an arrow sped from his bow.\"thus did he speak, and lycaon's heart sank within him. he loosed hishold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but achillesdrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; heplunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he layat full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him tillthe earth was soaked. then achilles caught him by the foot and flunghim into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him the while, andsaying, \"lie there among the fishes, who will lick the blood from yourwound and gloat over it; your mother shall not lay you on any bier tomourn you, but the eddies of scamander shall bear you into the broadbosom of the sea. there shall the fishes feed on the fat of lycaon asthey dart under the dark ripple of the waters--so perish all of youtill we reach the citadel of strong ilius--you in flight, and ifollowing after to destroy you. the river with its broad silver streamshall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you offered him and allthe horses that you flung living into his waters. none the lessmiserably shall you perish till there is not a man of you but has paidin full for the death of patroclus and the havoc you wrought among theachaeans whom you have slain while i held aloof from battle.\"so spoke achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and ponderedwithin himself how he should stay the hand of achilles and save thetrojans from disaster. meanwhile the son of peleus, spear in hand,sprang upon asteropaeus son of pelegon to kill him. he was son to thebroad river axius and periboea eldest daughter of acessamenus; for theriver had lain with her. asteropaeus stood up out of the water to facehim with a spear in either hand, and xanthus filled him with courage,being angry for the death of the youths whom achilles was slayingruthlessly within his waters. when they were close up with one anotherachilles was first to speak. \"who and whence are you,\" said he, \"whodare to face me? woe to the parents whose son stands up against me.\"and the son of pelegon answered, \"great son of peleus, why should youask my lineage. i am from the fertile land of far paeonia, captain ofthe paeonians, and it is now eleven days that i am at ilius. i am ofthe blood of the river axius--of axius that is the fairest of allrivers that run. he begot the famed warrior pelegon, whose son men callme. let us now fight, achilles.\"thus did he defy him, and achilles raised his spear of pelian ash.asteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both handsalike; with the one spear he struck achilles' shield, but did notpierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;with the other spear he grazed the elbow of achilles' right arm drawingdark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in theground, foiled of its bloody banquet. then achilles, fain to kill him,hurled his spear at asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck thesteep bank of the river, driving the spear half its length into theearth. the son of peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously uponhim. asteropaeus vainly tried to draw achilles' spear out of the bankby main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might todraw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth time hetried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so achilles smote himwith his sword and killed him. he struck him in the belly near thenavel, so that all his bowels came gushing out on to the ground, andthe darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping. then achillesset his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour, vaunting overhim and saying, \"lie there--begotten of a river though you be, it ishard for you to strive with the offspring of saturn's son. you declareyourself sprung from the blood of a broad river, but i am of the seedof mighty jove. my father is peleus, son of aeacus ruler over the manymyrmidons, and aeacus was the son of jove. therefore as jove ismightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are his childrenstronger than those of any river whatsoever. moreover you have a greatriver hard by if he can be of any use to you, but there is no fightingagainst jove the son of saturn, with whom not even king achelous cancompare, nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing oceanus, from whom allrivers and seas with all springs and deep wells proceed; even oceanusfears the lightnings of great jove, and his thunder that comes crashingout of heaven.\"with this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that he hadkilled asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand, with thedark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling andgnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. then he went in chase ofthe paeonians, who were flying along the bank of the river in panicwhen they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of peleus.therein he slew thersilochus, mydon, astypylus, mnesus, thrasius,oeneus, and ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not theriver in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the deepwaters saying, \"achilles, if you excel all in strength, so do you alsoin wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect you: if, then,the son of saturn has vouchsafed it to you to destroy all the trojans,at any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your grim work on land.my fair waters are now filled with corpses, nor can i find any channelby which i may pour myself into the sea for i am choked with dead, andyet you go on mercilessly slaying. i am in despair, therefore, ocaptain of your host, trouble me no further.\"achilles answered, \"so be it, scamander, jove-descended; but i willnever cease dealing out death among the trojans, till i have pent themup in their city, and made trial of hector face to face, that i maylearn whether he is to vanquish me, or i him.\"as he spoke he set upon the trojans with a fury like that of the gods.but the river said to apollo, \"surely, son of jove, lord of the silverbow, you are not obeying the commands of jove who charged you straitlythat you should stand by the trojans and defend them, till twilightfades, and darkness is over the earth.\"meanwhile achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon theriver raised a high wave and attacked him. he swelled his stream into atorrent, and swept away the many dead whom achilles had slain and leftwithin his waters. these he cast out on to the land, bellowing like abull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them in hismighty eddies. the great and terrible wave gathered about achilles,falling upon him and beating on his shield, so that he could not keephis feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it came up by theroots, and tore away the bank, damming the stream with its thickbranches and bridging it all across; whereby achilles struggled out ofthe stream, and fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid.but the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him witha dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the trojans fromdestruction. the son of peleus darted away a spear's throw from him;swift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest andfleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the armourrang loudly about his breast. he fled on in front, but the river with aloud roar came tearing after. as one who would water his garden leads astream from some fountain over his plants, and all his ground--spade inhand he clears away the dams to free the channels, and the littlestones run rolling round and round with the water as it goes merrilydown the bank faster than the man can follow--even so did the riverkeep catching up with achilles albeit he was a fleet runner, for thegods are stronger than men. as often as he would strive to stand hisground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven were in leagueagainst him, so often would the mighty wave come beating down upon hisshoulders, and he would have to keep flying on and on in great dismay;for the angry flood was tiring him out as it flowed past him and atethe ground from under his feet.then the son of peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, \"fatherjove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save mefrom the river? i do not care what may happen to me afterwards. i blamenone of the other dwellers on olympus so severely as i do my dearmother, who has beguiled and tricked me. she told me i was to fallunder the walls of troy by the flying arrows of apollo; would thathector, the best man among the trojans, might there slay me; thenshould i fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that ishall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as though iwere some swineherd's boy, who gets carried down a torrent while tryingto cross it during a storm.\"as soon as he had spoken thus, neptune and minerva came up to him inthe likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.neptune spoke first. \"son of peleus,\" said he, \"be not so exceedingfearful; we are two gods, come with jove's sanction to assist you, i,and pallas minerva. it is not your fate to perish in this river; hewill abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you,if you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting tillyou have pent the trojan host within the famed walls of ilius--as manyof them as may escape. then kill hector and go back to the ships, forwe will vouchsafe you a triumph over him.\"when they had so said they went back to the other immortals, butachilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge thegods had laid upon him. all was now covered with the flood of waters,and much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain was riftingabout, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream,speeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, forminerva had endowed him with great strength. nevertheless scamander didnot slacken in his pursuit, but was still more furious with the son ofpeleus. he lifted his waters into a high crest and cried aloud tosimois saying, \"dear brother, let the two of us unite to save this man,or he will sack the mighty city of king priam, and the trojans will nothold out against him. help me at once; fill your streams with waterfrom their sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your waveon high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you that we maymake an end of this savage creature who is now lording it as though hewere a god. nothing shall serve him longer, not strength norcomeliness, nor his fine armour, which forsooth shall soon be lying lowin the deep waters covered over with mud. i will wrap him in sand, andpour tons of shingle round him, so that the achaeans shall not know howto gather his bones for the silt in which i shall have hidden him, andwhen they celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow.\"on this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against achilles,seething as it was with foam and blood and the bodies of the dead. thedark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed theson of peleus, but juno, trembling lest achilles should be swept awayin the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out tovulcan her son. \"crook-foot,\" she cried, \"my child, be up and doing,for i deem it is with you that xanthus is fain to fight; help us atonce, kindle a fierce fire; i will then bring up the west and the whitesouth wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear theflames against the heads and armour of the trojans and consume them,while you go along the banks of xanthus burning his trees and wrappinghim round with fire. let him not turn you back neither by fair wordsnor foul, and slacken not till i shout and tell you. then you may stayyour flames.\"on this vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon theplain and burned the many dead whom achilles had killed and whosebodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain wasdried and the flood stayed. as the north wind, blowing on an orchardthat has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and the heart ofthe owner is glad--even so the whole plain was dried and the deadbodies were consumed. then he turned tongues of fire on to the river.he burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also, withthe rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the banks of theriver. the eels and fishes that go darting about everywhere in thewater, these, too, were sorely harassed by the flames that cunningvulcan had kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so that he spokesaying, \"vulcan, there is no god can hold his own against you. i cannotfight you when you flare out your flames in this way; strive with me nolonger. let achilles drive the trojans out of their city immediately.what have i to do with quarrelling and helping people?\"he was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. as acauldron upon a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of somefatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the dryfaggots blaze under it--even so were the goodly waters of xanthusheated with the fire till they were boiling. he could flow no longerbut stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire whichcunning vulcan had raised. then he prayed to juno and besought hersaying, \"juno, why should your son vex my stream with such especialfury? i am not so much to blame as all the others are who have beenhelping the trojans. i will leave off, since you so desire it, and letyour son leave off also. furthermore i swear never again will i doanything to save the trojans from destruction, not even when all troyis burning in the flames which the achaeans will kindle.\"as soon as juno heard this she said to her son vulcan, \"son vulcan,hold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence against a godfor the sake of mortals.\"when she had thus spoken vulcan quenched his flames, and the river wentback once more into his own fair bed.xanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for juno stayedthem though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke out amongthe other gods, for they were of divided counsels. they fell on oneanother with a mighty uproar--earth groaned, and the spacious firmamentrang out as with a blare of trumpets. jove heard as he was sitting onolympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows amongthemselves. they were not long about beginning, and mars piercer ofshields opened the battle. sword in hand he sprang at once upon minervaand reviled her. \"why, vixen,\" said he, \"have you again set the gods bythe ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart? have you forgottenhow you set diomed son of tydeus on to wound me, and yourself tookvisible spear and drove it into me to the hurt of my fair body? youshall now suffer for what you then did to me.\"as he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis--so terriblethat not even can jove's lightning pierce it. here did murderous marsstrike her with his great spear. she drew back and with her strong handseized a stone that was lying on the plain--great and rugged andblack--which men of old had set for the boundary of a field. with thisshe struck mars on the neck, and brought him down. nine roods did hecover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in the dust, while hisarmour rang rattling round him. but minerva laughed and vaunted overhim saying, \"idiot, have you not learned how far stronger i am thanyou, but you must still match yourself against me? thus do yourmother's curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would do youmischief because you have deserted the achaeans and are helping thetrojans.\"she then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon jove'sdaughter venus took mars by the hand and led him away groaning all thetime, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come to himselfagain. when queen juno saw her, she said to minerva, \"look, daughter ofaegis-bearing jove, unweariable, that vixen venus is again taking marsthrough the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once.\"thus she spoke. minerva sped after venus with a will, and made at her,striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fellfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at fulllength. then minerva vaunted over her saying, \"may all who help thetrojans against the argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart asvenus did when she came across me while she was helping mars. had thisbeen so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking the strongcity of ilius.\"juno smiled as she listened. meanwhile king neptune turned to apollosaying, \"phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm's length? it isnot well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will bedisgraceful to us if we return to jove's bronze-floored mansion onolympus without having fought each other; therefore come on, you arethe younger of the two, and i ought not to attack you, for i am olderand have had more experience. idiot, you have no sense, and forget howwe two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about ilius when wecame from jove's house and worked for laomedon a whole year at a statedwage and he gave us his orders. i built the trojans the wall abouttheir city, so wide and fair that it might be impregnable, while you,phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of many valleyed ida. when,however, the glad hours brought round the time of payment, mightylaomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent us off with nothing butabuse. he threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us over intosome distant island. he tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both ofus, so we went away in a rage, furious about the payment he hadpromised us, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are nowshowing favour to his people, and will not join us in compassing theutter ruin of the proud trojans with their wives and children.\"and king apollo answered, \"lord of the earthquake, you would have norespect for me if i were to fight you about a pack of miserablemortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of thefield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. let us stay thisfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.\"he turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother ofhis own father. but his sister the huntress diana, patroness of wildbeasts, was very angry with him and said, \"so you would fly,far-darter, and hand victory over to neptune with a cheap vaunt toboot. baby, why keep your bow thus idle? never let me again hear youbragging in my father's house, as you have often done in the presenceof the immortals, that you would stand up and fight with neptune.\"apollo made her no answer, but jove's august queen was angry andupbraided her bitterly. \"bold vixen,\" she cried, \"how dare you cross methus? for all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own againstme. jove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill themwhenever you choose. you will find it better to chase wild beasts anddeer upon the mountains than to fight those who are stronger than youare. if you would try war, do so, and find out by pitting yourselfagainst me, how far stronger i am than you are.\"she caught both diana's wrists with her left hand as she spoke, andwith her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as shebeat her with it about the ears while diana wriggled and writhed underher blows. her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she fledweeping from under juno's hand as a dove that flies before a falcon tothe cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune to escape.even so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows behind her.then the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, said to leto, \"leto, ishall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of jove'swives. therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worstedme in fair fight.\"leto then gathered up diana's bow and arrows that had fallen about amidthe whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste afterher daughter. diana had now reached jove's bronze-floored mansion onolympus, and sat herself down with many tears on the knees of herfather, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all about her. theson of saturn drew her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the whilebegan to question her saying, \"which of the heavenly beings, my dearchild, has been treating you in this cruel manner, as though you hadbeen misconducting yourself in the face of everybody?\" and thefair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, \"it was your wife juno,father, who has been beating me; it is always her doing when there isany quarrelling among the immortals.\"thus did they converse, and meanwhile phoebus apollo entered the strongcity of ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out andthe danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour hadcome; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry andsome triumphant to olympus, where they took their seats beside jovelord of the storm cloud, while achilles still kept on dealing out deathalike on the trojans and on their horses. as when the smoke from someburning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the gods has kindledit--there is then toil for all, and sorrow for not a few--even so didachilles bring toil and sorrow on the trojans.old king priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on hugeachilles as the trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there wasnone to help them. presently he came down from off the tower and withmany a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave warders ofthe gate. \"keep the gates,\" said he, \"wide open till the people comeflying into the city, for achilles is hard by and is driving them inrout before him. i see we are in great peril. as soon as our people areinside and in safety, close the strong gates for i fear lest thatterrible man should come bounding inside along with the others.\"as he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and whenthese were opened there was a haven of refuge for the trojans. apollothen came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect them.right for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimywith dust, still they fied on, with achilles wielding his spearfuriously behind them. for he was as one possessed, and was thirstingafter glory.then had the sons of the achaeans taken the lofty gates of troy ifapollo had not spurred on agenor, valiant and noble son to antenor. heput courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him, leaningagainst a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. when agenor sawachilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with care. \"alas,\"said he to himself in his dismay, \"if i fly before mighty achilles, andgo where all the others are being driven in rout, he will none the lesscatch me and kill me for a coward. how would it be were i to letachilles drive the others before him, and then fly from the wall to theplain that is behind ilius till i reach the spurs of ida and can hidein the underwood that is thereon? i could then wash the sweat from offme in the river and in the evening return to ilius. but why communewith myself in this way? like enough he would see me as i am hurryingfrom the city over the plain, and would speed after me till he hadcaught me--i should stand no chance against him, for he is mightiest ofall mankind. what, then, if i go out and meet him in front of the city?his flesh too, i take it, can be pierced by pointed bronze. life is thesame in one and all, and men say that he is but mortal despite thetriumph that jove son of saturn vouchsafes him.\"so saying he stood on his guard and awaited achilles, for he was nowfain to fight him. as a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covertto attack a hunter--she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the bayingof the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound hereither with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced hershe will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or beenkilled outright--even so did noble agenor son of antenor refuse to flytill he had made trial of achilles, and took aim at him with his spear,holding his round shield before him and crying with a loud voice. \"of atruth,\" said he, \"noble achilles, you deem that you shall this day sackthe city of the proud trojans. fool, there will be trouble enough yetbefore it, for there is many a brave man of us still inside who willstand in front of our dear parents with our wives and children, todefend ilius. here therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be,here shall you die.\"as he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the spearstruck achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newlywrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of himwhom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the god's gift stayedit. achilles in his turn attacked noble agenor, but apollo would notvouchsafe him glory, for he snatched agenor away and hid him in a thickmist, sending him out of the battle unmolested. then he craftily drewthe son of peleus away from going after the host, for he put on thesemblance of agenor and stood in front of achilles, who ran towards himto give him chase and pursued him over the corn lands of the plain,turning him towards the deep waters of the river scamander. apollo ranbut a little way before him and beguiled achilles by making him thinkall the time that he was on the point of overtaking him. meanwhile therabble of routed trojans was thankful to crowd within the city tilltheir numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait for one anotheroutside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were fallen infight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them pouredpell-mell into the town.book xxii  the death of hector.thus the trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat fromoff them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the goodlybattlements, while the achaeans with their shields laid upon theirshoulders drew close up to the walls. but stern fate bade hector staywhere he was before ilius and the scaean gates. then phoebus apollospoke to the son of peleus saying, \"why, son of peleus, do you, who arebut man, give chase to me who am immortal? have you not yet found outthat it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? you did not harass thetrojans whom you had routed, and now they are within their walls, whileyou have been decoyed hither away from them. me you cannot kill, fordeath can take no hold upon me.\"achilles was greatly angered and said, \"you have baulked me,far-darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from thewall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he gotwithin ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved thetrojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but iwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.\"on this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winninghorse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over theplain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of achilles bear himonwards. king priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain, allradiant as the star which men call orion's hound, and whose beams blazeforth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any other thatshines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes illfor mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train--even so didachilles' armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. priam raised acry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up and shoutedout to his dear son, imploring him to return; but hector still stayedbefore the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle withachilles. the old man reached out his arms towards him and bade him forpity's sake come within the walls. \"hector,\" he cried, \"my son, staynot to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will meet death atthe hands of the son of peleus, for he is mightier than you. monsterthat he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better than i do,for so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched onearth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many abrave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or selling themaway in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now i miss two sonsfrom among the trojans who have thronged within the city, lycaon andpolydorus, whom laothoe peeress among women bore me. should they bestill alive and in the hands of the achaeans, we will ransom them withgold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man altes endowedhis daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the house ofhades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeit thegrief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perish at thehands of achilles. come, then, my son, within the city, to be theguardian of trojan men and trojan women, or you will both lose your ownlife and afford a mighty triumph to the son of peleus. have pity alsoon your unhappy father while life yet remains to him--on me, whom theson of saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of oldage, after i have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away ascaptives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children dashed to earthamid the rage of battle, and my sons' wives dragged away by the cruelhands of the achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will tear me in piecesat my own gates after some one has beaten the life out of my body withsword or spear-hounds that i myself reared and fed at my own table toguard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and then lie alldistraught at my doors. when a young man falls by the sword in battle,he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will beseen, all is honourable in death, but when an old man is slain there isnothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile hisgrey hair and beard and all that men hide for shame.\"the old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heartof hector. his mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared herbosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. \"hector,\" shecried, weeping bitterly the while, \"hector, my son, spurn not thisbreast, but have pity upon me too: if i have ever given you comfortfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wallto protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. should thewretch kill you, neither i nor your richly dowered wife shall everweep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogswill devour you at the ships of the achaeans.\"thus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved notthe heart of hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge achilles ashe drew nearer towards him. as a serpent in its den upon the mountains,full fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man--he isfilled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing roundhis den--even so hector leaned his shield against a tower that juttedout from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.\"alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \"if i gowithin the gates, polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon me,for it was he that urged me to lead the trojans back to the city onthat awful night when achilles again came forth against us. i would notlisten, but it would have been indeed better if i had done so. now thatmy folly has destroyed the host, i dare not look trojan men and trojanwomen in the face, lest a worse man should say, 'hector has ruined usby his self-confidence.' surely it would be better for me to returnafter having fought achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously herebefore the city. what, again, if i were to lay down my shield andhelmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up to nobleachilles? what if i were to promise to give up helen, who was thefountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that alexandrusbrought with him in his ships to troy, aye, and to let the achaeansdivide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?i might make the trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take a solemnoath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into two shares allthat is within the city--but why argue with myself in this way? were ito go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would kill methen and there as easily as though i were a woman, when i had off myarmour. there is no parleying with him from some rock or oak tree asyoung men and maidens prattle with one another. better fight him atonce, and learn to which of us jove will vouchsafe victory.\"thus did he stand and ponder, but achilles came up to him as it weremars himself, plumed lord of battle. from his right shoulder hebrandished his terrible spear of pelian ash, and the bronze gleamedaround him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. fear fellupon hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he wasbut fled in dismay from before the gates, while achilles darted afterhim at his utmost speed. as a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds,swoops down upon some cowering dove--the dove flies before him but thefalcon with a shrill scream follows close after, resolved to haveher--even so did achilles make straight for hector with all his might,while hector fled under the trojan wall as fast as his limbs could takehim.on they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall,past the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree,till they came to two fair springs which feed the river scamander. oneof these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke from aburning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail or snow,or the ice that forms on water. here, hard by the springs, are thegoodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace before thecoming of the achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the trojans usedto wash their clothes. past these did they fly, the one in front andthe other giving chase behind him: good was the man that fled, butbetter far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did they run,for the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice or bullock's hide, as itmight be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life of hector.as horses in a chariot race speed round the turning-posts when they arerunning for some great prize--a tripod or woman--at the games in honourof some dead hero, so did these two run full speed three times roundthe city of priam. all the gods watched them, and the sire of gods andmen was the first to speak.\"alas,\" said he, \"my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursuedround the walls of troy; my heart is full of pity for hector, who hasburned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, one while on thecrests of many-valleyed ida, and again on the citadel of troy; and nowi see noble achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of priam.what say you? consider among yourselves and decide whether we shall nowsave him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before achilles, son ofpeleus.\"then minerva said, \"father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud andstorm, what mean you? would you pluck this mortal whose doom has longbeen decreed out of the jaws of death? do as you will, but we othersshall not be of a mind with you.\"and jove answered, \"my child, trito-born, take heart. i did not speakin full earnest, and i will let you have your way. do without let orhindrance as you are minded.\"thus did he urge minerva who was already eager, and down she dartedfrom the topmost summits of olympus.achilles was still in full pursuit of hector, as a hound chasing a fawnwhich he has started from its covert on the mountains, and huntsthrough glade and thicket. the fawn may try to elude him by crouchingunder cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her upuntil he gets her--even so there was no escape for hector from thefleet son of peleus. whenever he made a set to get near the dardaniangates and under the walls, that his people might help him by showeringdown weapons from above, achilles would gain on him and head him backtowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. as a man ina dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing--theone cannot escape nor the other overtake--even so neither couldachilles come up with hector, nor hector break away from achilles;nevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time comewhen apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved hisrunning, was now no longer to stay by him. achilles made signs to theachaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim a dartat hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and hemight himself come in second. then, at last, as they were nearing thefountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced his goldenscales and placed a doom in each of them, one for achilles and theother for hector. as he held the scales by the middle, the doom ofhector fell down deep into the house of hades--and then phoebus apolloleft him. thereon minerva went close up to the son of peleus and said,\"noble achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back tothe ships a triumph for the achaeans by slaying hector, for all hislust of battle. do what apollo may as he lies grovelling before hisfather, aegis-bearing jove, hector cannot escape us longer. stay hereand take breath, while i go up to him and persuade him to make a standand fight you.\"thus spoke minerva. achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while minerva left him andwent after hector in the form and with the voice of deiphobus. she cameclose up to him and said, \"dear brother, i see you are hard pressed byachilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of priam, letus await his onset and stand on our defence.\"and hector answered, \"deiphobus, you have always been dearest to me ofall my brothers, children of hecuba and priam, but henceforth i shallrate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside thewall for my sake when all the others remain inside.\"then minerva said, \"dear brother, my father and mother went down ontheir knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside,so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but i was in an agony ofgrief when i beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand andfight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we maylearn whether achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to theships, or whether he shall fall before you.\"thus did minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were nowclose to one another great hector was first to speak. \"i will no longerfly you, son of peleus,\" said he, \"as i have been doing hitherto. threetimes have i fled round the mighty city of priam, without daring towithstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for i am in themind to face you. let us, then, give pledges to one another by ourgods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants; letit be agreed between us that if jove vouchsafes me the longer stay andi take your life, i am not to treat your dead body in any unseemlyfashion, but when i have stripped you of your armour, i am to give upyour body to the achaeans. and do you likewise.\"achilles glared at him and answered, \"fool, prate not to me aboutcovenants. there can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves andlambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out allthrough. therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall falland glut grim mars with his life's blood. put forth all your strength;you have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier and man ofwar. you have no more chance, and pallas minerva will forthwithvanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the griefyou have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed inbattle.\"he poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. hector saw it coming andavoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over hishead and stuck in the ground beyond; minerva then snatched it up andgave it back to achilles without hector's seeing her; hector thereonsaid to the son of peleus, \"you have missed your aim, achilles, peer ofthe gods, and jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of my doom,though you made sure that he had done so. you were a false-tongued liarwhen you deemed that i should forget my valour and quail before you.you shall not drive your spear into the back of a runaway--drive it,should heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as i make straighttowards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can--wouldthat you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you were oncedead the trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it is you whohave harmed them most.\"he poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. his aim was true for hehit the middle of achilles' shield, but the spear rebounded from it,and did not pierce it. hector was angry when he saw that the weapon hadsped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had nosecond spear. with a loud cry he called deiphobus and asked him forone, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself,\"alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. i deemed that thehero deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and minervahas inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand andthere is no way out of it--for so jove and his son apollo thefar-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever readyto protect me. my doom has come upon me; let me not then dieingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some greatthing that shall be told among men hereafter.\"as he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by hisside, and gathering himself together be sprang on achilles like asoaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb ortimid hare--even so did hector brandish his sword and spring uponachilles. achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrousshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with fourlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. the thick tresses of goldwith which vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as theevening star that shines brighter than all others through the stillnessof night, even such was the gleam of the spear which achilles poised inhis right hand, fraught with the death of noble hector. he eyed hisfair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it, but allwas protected by the goodly armour of which hector had spoiledpatroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where thecollar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a mostdeadly place: here then did achilles strike him as he was coming ontowards him, and the point of his spear went right through the fleshypart of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he couldstill speak. hector fell headlong, and achilles vaunted over himsaying, \"hector, you deemed that you should come off scatheless whenyou were spoiling patroclus, and recked not of myself who was not withhim. fool that you were: for i, his comrade, mightier far than he, wasstill left behind him at the ships, and now i have laid you low. theachaeans shall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vulturesshall work their will upon yourself.\"then hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, \"i pray you by yourlife and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at theships of the achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronzewhich my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home, thatthe trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when i am dead.\"achilles glared at him and answered, \"dog, talk not to me neither ofknees nor parents; would that i could be as sure of being able to cutyour flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill you have done me, asi am that nothing shall save you from the dogs--it shall not be, thoughthey bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on thespot, with promise of yet more hereafter. though priam son of dardanusshould bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so your mother shallnever lay you out and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs andvultures shall eat you utterly up.\"hector with his dying breath then said, \"i know you what you are, andwas sure that i should not move you, for your heart is hard as iron;look to it that i bring not heaven's anger upon you on the day whenparis and phoebus apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you at thescaean gates.\"when he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon hissoul went out of him and flew down to the house of hades, lamenting itssad fate that it should enjoy youth and strength no longer. butachilles said, speaking to the dead body, \"die; for my part i willaccept my fate whensoever jove and the other gods see fit to send it.\"as he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side;then he stripped the blood-stained armour from hector's shoulders whilethe other achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength andbeauty; and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound. thenwould one turn to his neighbour and say, \"it is easier to handle hectornow than when he was flinging fire on to our ships\"--and as he spoke hewould thrust his spear into him anew.when achilles had done spoiling hector of his armour, he stood amongthe argives and said, \"my friends, princes and counsellors of theargives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, whohas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether weshould not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind thetrojans may be. we should thus learn whether they will desert theircity now that hector has fallen, or will still hold out even though heis no longer living. but why argue with myself in this way, whilepatroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned--he whomi can never forget so long as i am alive and my strength fails not?though men forget their dead when once they are within the house ofhades, yet not even there will i forget the comrade whom i have lost.now, therefore, achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory and goback to the ships taking this man along with us; for we have achieved amighty triumph and have slain noble hector to whom the trojans prayedthroughout their city as though he were a god.\"on this he treated the body of hector with contumely: he pierced thesinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passedthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the bodyfast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. then whenhe had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted, helashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. the dust rosefrom hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew allabroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for jove hadnow delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outrage in hisown land.thus was the head of hector being dishonoured in the dust. his mothertore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as shelooked upon her son. his father made piteous moan, and throughout thecity the people fell to weeping and wailing. it was as though the wholeof frowning ilius was being smirched with fire. hardly could the peoplehold priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates of the city.he grovelled in the mire and besought them, calling each one of them byhis name. \"let be, my friends,\" he cried, \"and for all your sorrow,suffer me to go single-handed to the ships of the achaeans. let mebeseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will respect thefeeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. his ownfather is even such another as myself--peleus, who bred him and rearedhim to be the bane of us trojans, and of myself more than of allothers. many a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his youth, andyet, grieve for these as i may, i do so for one--hector--more than forthem all, and the bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to thehouse of hades. would that he had died in my arms, for so both hisill-starred mother who bore him, and myself, should have had thecomfort of weeping and mourning over him.\"thus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the cityjoined in his lament. hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among thetrojans. \"alas, my son,\" she cried, \"what have i left to live for nowthat you are no more? night and day did i glory in you throughout thecity, for you were a tower of strength to all in troy, and both men andwomen alike hailed you as a god. so long as you lived you were theirpride, but now death and destruction have fallen upon you.\"hector's wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell herthat her husband had remained without the gates. she was at her loom inan inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, andembroidering it with many flowers. she told her maids to set a largetripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for hector when hecame out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond thereach of baths, and that minerva had laid him low by the hands ofachilles. she heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled inevery limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke to herwaiting-women. \"two of you,\" she said, \"come with me that i may learnwhat it is that has befallen; i heard the voice of my husband'shonoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would come into mymouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune forpriam's children must be at hand. may i never live to hear it, but igreatly fear that achilles has cut off the retreat of brave hector andhas chased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; i fear he mayhave put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband, whowould never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far infront, foremost of them all in valour.\"her heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like amaniac, with her waiting-women following after. when she reached thebattlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon thewall, and saw hector being borne away in front of the city--the horsesdragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships ofthe achaeans. her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of nightand she fell fainting backwards. she tore the attiring from her headand flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, andthe veil which golden venus had given her on the day when hector tookher with him from the house of eetion, after having given countlessgifts of wooing for her sake. her husband's sisters and the wives ofhis brothers crowded round her and supported her, for she was fain todie in her distraction; when she again presently breathed and came toherself, she sobbed and made lament among the trojans saying, \"woe isme, o hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, youat troy in the house of priam, and i at thebes under the woodedmountain of placus in the house of eetion who brought me up when i wasa child--ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter--would that he hadnever begotten me. you are now going into the house of hades under thesecret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in yourhouse. the child, of whom you and i are the unhappy parents, is as yeta mere infant. now that you are gone, o hector, you can do nothing forhim nor he for you. even though he escape the horrors of this woefulwar with the achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be one of labourand sorrow, for others will seize his lands. the day that robs a childof his parents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, hischeeks are wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among thefriends of his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by theshirt. some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold thecup for a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he mustnot drink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parentsare alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.'out with you,' he will say, 'you have no father here,' and the childwill go crying back to his widowed mother--he, astyanax, who erewhilewould sit upon his father's knees, and have none but the daintiest andchoicest morsels set before him. when he had played till he was tiredand went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, ona soft couch, knowing neither want nor care, whereas now that he haslost his father his lot will be full of hardship--he, whom the trojansname astyanax, because you, o hector, were the only defence of theirgates and battlements. the wriggling writhing worms will now eat you atthe ships, far from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselvesupon you. you will lie naked, although in your house you have fine andgoodly raiment made by hands of women. this will i now burn; it is ofno use to you, for you can never again wear it, and thus you will haverespect shown you by the trojans both men and women.\"in such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined inher lament.book xxiii  the funeral of patroclus, and the funeral games.thus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the achaeanswhen they reached the hellespont went back every man to his own ship.but achilles would not let the myrmidons go, and spoke to his bravecomrades saying, \"myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends,not yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw nearto the body and mourn patroclus, in due honour to the dead. when wehave had full comfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses and takesupper all of us here.\"on this they all joined in a cry of wailing and achilles led them intheir lament. thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing roundthe body, and thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning. thesands of the seashore and the men's armour were wet with their weeping,so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. chief in alltheir mourning was the son of peleus: he laid his bloodstained hand onthe breast of his friend. \"fare well,\" he cried, \"patroclus, even inthe house of hades. i will now do all that i erewhile promised you; iwill drag hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sonsof trojans will i also slay before your pyre to avenge you.\"as he spoke he treated the body of noble hector with contumely, layingit at full length in the dust beside the bier of patroclus. the othersthen put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots,and seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleetdescendant of aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an abundant funeralbanquet. many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did theybutcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, didthey singe and set to roast in the flames of vulcan; and rivulets ofblood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.then the princes of the achaeans took the son of peleus to agamemnon,but hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so wroth was hefor the death of his comrade. as soon as they reached agamemnon's tentthey told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire in casethey might persuade the son of peleus to wash the clotted gore fromthis body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath,saying, \"nay, by king jove, first and mightiest of all gods, it is notmeet that water should touch my body, till i have laid patroclus on theflames, have built him a barrow, and shaved my head--for so long as ilive no such second sorrow shall ever draw nigh me. now, therefore, letus do all that this sad festival demands, but at break of day, kingagamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and provide all else that the deadmay duly take into the realm of darkness; the fire shall thus burn himout of our sight the sooner, and the people shall turn again to theirown labours.\"thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. they made haste toprepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so thatall were satisfied. as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son ofpeleus lay grieving among his myrmidons by the shore of the soundingsea, in an open place where the waves came surging in one afteranother. here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and eased theburden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing hectorround windy ilius. presently the sad spirit of patroclus drew near him,like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of his beamingeyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. the spirit hovered overhis head and said--\"you sleep, achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living, butnow that i am dead you think for me no further. bury me with all speedthat i may pass the gates of hades; the ghosts, vain shadows of menthat can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will not yetsuffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and i wander alldesolate by the wide gates of the house of hades. give me now your handi pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire, nevershall i again come forth out of the house of hades. nevermore shall wesit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the cruel fate whichwas my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me--nay, you tooachilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the wall of the nobletrojans.\"one prayer more will i make you, if you will grant it; let not mybones be laid apart from yours, achilles, but with them; even as wewere brought up together in your own home, what time menoetius broughtme to you as a child from opoeis because by a sad spite i had killedthe son of amphidamas--not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel overthe dice. the knight peleus took me into his house, entreated mekindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones lie inbut a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by yourmother.\"and achilles answered, \"why, true heart, are you come hither to laythese charges upon me? i will of my own self do all as you have biddenme. draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around oneanother, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.\"he opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped himin them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a vapour,gibbering and whining into the earth. achilles sprang to his feet,smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, \"of a truth even inthe house of hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have no life inthem; all night long the sad spirit of patroclus has hovered over headmaking piteous moan, telling me what i am to do for him, and lookingwondrously like himself.\"thus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning aboutthe poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. then kingagamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring wood,and meriones, squire to idomeneus, was in charge over them. they wentout with woodmen's axes and strong ropes in their hands, and beforethem went the mules. up hill and down dale did they go, by straightways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of many-fountainedida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall branching oakthat came thundering down as they felled it. they split the trees andbound them behind the mules, which then wended their way as they bestcould through the thick brushwood on to the plain. all who had beencutting wood bore logs, for so meriones squire to idomeneus had biddenthem, and they threw them down in a line upon the seashore at the placewhere achilles would make a mighty monument for patroclus and forhimself.when they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the wholeground, they stayed all of them where they were, but achilles orderedhis brave myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man hishorses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted eachhis chariot--they and their charioteers with them. the chariots wentbefore, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens ofthousands after. in the midst of them his comrades bore patroclus andcovered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and threwupon his body. last came achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, sonoble a comrade was he taking to the house of hades.when they came to the place of which achilles had told them they laidthe body down and built up the wood. achilles then bethought him ofanother matter. he went a space away from the pyre, and cut off theyellow lock which he had let grow for the river spercheius. he lookedall sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, \"spercheius, in vaindid my father peleus vow to you that when i returned home to my lovednative land i should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb;fifty she-goats was i to sacrifice to you there at your springs, whereis your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. thus did myfather vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore, thati shall see my home no more, i give this lock as a keepsake to the heropatroclus.\"as he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, andall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. the sunwould have gone down upon their mourning had not achilles presentlysaid to agamemnon, \"son of atreus, for it is to you that the peoplewill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease frommourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting theirdinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is wantedhere, and let the other princes also stay by me.\"when king agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships,but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre ahundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfullyupon the top of it. they flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxenbefore the pyre, and achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped thebody therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all roundit. against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents;four proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while hedid so. the dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did achilles slayand threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave sons of noble trojansto the sword and laid them with the rest, for he was full of bitternessand fury. then he committed all to the resistless and devouring mightof the fire; he groaned aloud and called on his dead comrade by name.\"fare well,\" he cried, \"patroclus, even in the house of hades; i am nowdoing all that i have promised you. twelve brave sons of noble trojansshall the flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shalldevour the flesh of hector son of priam.\"thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of hector, forjove's daughter venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed himwith ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn whenachilles was dragging him about. phoebus apollo moreover sent a darkcloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place wherehector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.now the pyre about dead patroclus would not kindle. achilles thereforebethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the twowinds boreas and zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. he made themmany drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come andhelp him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead bodiesbe consumed. fleet iris heard him praying and started off to fetch thewinds. they were holding high feast in the house of boisterous zephyruswhen iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house and stoodthere, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards herand each of them called her to him, but iris would not sit down. \"icannot stay,\" she said, \"i must go back to the streams of oceanus andthe land of the ethiopians who are offering hecatombs to the immortals,and i would have my share; but achilles prays that boreas and shrillzephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly offerings; he wouldhave you blow upon the pyre of patroclus for whom all the achaeans arelamenting.\"with this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rentthe air and swept the clouds before them. they blew on and on untilthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but whenthey reached troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roaredunder the blast that they blew. all night long did they blow hard andbeat upon the fire, and all night long did achilles grasp his doublecup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon thespirit of dead patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until theearth was drenched. as a father mourns when he is burning the bones ofhis bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents,even so did achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade,pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.at length as the morning star was beginning to herald the light whichsaffron-mantled dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames felland the fire began to die. the winds then went home beyond the thraciansea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. the son of peleusnow turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with toil, till hefell into a sweet slumber. presently they who were about the son ofatreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise and tramp oftheir coming. he sat upright and said, \"son of atreus, and all otherprinces of the achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fireand quench it; let us then gather the bones of patroclus son ofmenoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found, for theylie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men and horses, hasbeen thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. we will lay thebones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against the time when ishall myself go down into the house of hades. as for the barrow, labournot to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable. afterwards,let those achaeans who may be left at the ships when i am gone, buildit both broad and high.\"thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of peleus. first theypoured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the fire.with many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their lovedcomrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat: theythen covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the tent.they marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made afoundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth.when they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but achillesstayed the people and made them sit in assembly. he brought prizes fromthe ships--cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women withfair girdles, and swart iron.the first prize he offered was for the chariot races--a woman skilledin all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears forhandles, and would hold twenty-two measures. this was for the man whocame in first. for the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken,and in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron thathad never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left themaker, and would hold four measures. the fourth prize was two talentsof gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. thenhe stood up and spoke among the argives saying--\"son of atreus, and all other achaeans, these are the prizes that liewaiting the winners of the chariot races. at any other time i shouldcarry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know how farmy steeds excel all others--for they are immortal; neptune gave them tomy father peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself; but i shall holdaloof, i and my steeds that have lost their brave and kind driver, whomany a time has washed them in clear water and anointed their maneswith oil. see how they stand weeping here, with their manes trailing onthe ground in the extremity of their sorrow. but do you others setyourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever has confidence inhis horses and in the strength of his chariot.\"thus spoke the son of peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirredthemselves. first among them all uprose eumelus, king of men, son ofadmetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. next to him rose mightydiomed son of tydeus; he yoked the trojan horses which he had takenfrom aeneas, when apollo bore him out of the fight. next to him,yellow-haired menelaus son of atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses,agamemnon's mare aethe, and his own horse podargus. the mare had beengiven to agamemnon by echepolus son of anchises, that he might not haveto follow him to ilius, but might stay at home and take his ease; forjove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious sicyon.this mare, all eager for the race, did menelaus put under the yoke.fourth in order antilochus, son to noble nestor son of neleus, madeready his horses. these were bred in pylos, and his father came up tohim to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but littleneed. \"antilochus,\" said nestor, \"you are young, but jove and neptunehave loved you well, and have made you an excellent horseman. i neednot therefore say much by way of instruction. you are skilful atwheeling your horses round the post, but the horses themselves are veryslow, and it is this that will, i fear, mar your chances. the otherdrivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter; therefore,my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby you mayinsure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers. the woodmandoes more by skill than by brute force; by skill the pilot guides hisstorm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by skill one driver can beatanother. if a man go wide in rounding this way and that, whereas a manwho knows what he is doing may have worse horses, but he will keep themwell in hand when he sees the doubling-post; he knows the precisemoment at which to pull the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man infront of him. i will give you this certain token which cannot escapeyour notice. there is a stump of a dead tree--oak or pine as it maybe--some six feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by rain; itstands at the fork of the road; it has two white stones set one on eachside, and there is a clear course all round it. it may have been amonument to some one long since dead, or it may have been used as adoubling-post in days gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on byachilles as the mark round which the chariots shall turn; hug it asclose as you can, but as you stand in your chariot lean over a littleto the left; urge on your right-hand horse with voice and lash, andgive him a loose rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in,that the nave of your wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind thestone, or you will wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces,which would be sport for others but confusion for yourself. therefore,my dear son, mind well what you are about, for if you can be first toround the post there is no chance of any one giving you the go-bylater, not even though you had adrestus's horse arion behind you--ahorse which is of divine race--or those of laomedon, which are thenoblest in this country.\"when nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in hisplace, and fifth in order meriones got ready his horses. they then allmounted their chariots and cast lots. achilles shook the helmet, andthe lot of antilochus son of nestor fell out first; next came that ofking eumelus, and after his, those of menelaus son of atreus and ofmeriones. the last place fell to the lot of diomed son of tydeus, whowas the best man of them all. they took their places in line; achillesshowed them the doubling-post round which they were to turn, some wayoff upon the plain; here he stationed his father's follower phoenix asumpire, to note the running, and report truly.at the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck themwith the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. they flewfull speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from underthem as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all flyingin the wind. at one moment the chariots seemed to touch the ground, andthen again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood erect, andtheir hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of victory. each keptcalling on his horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the cloudsof dust that they raised.it was when they were doing the last part of the course on their wayback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and itwas seen what each could do. the horses of the descendant of pheres nowtook the lead, and close behind them came the trojan stallions ofdiomed. they seemed as if about to mount eumelus's chariot, and hecould feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders,for their heads were close to him as they flew over the course. diomedwould have now passed him, or there would have been a dead heat, butphoebus apollo to spite him made him drop his whip. tears of anger fellfrom his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever, while hisown horses lost ground through his having no whip. minerva saw thetrick which apollo had played the son of tydeus, so she brought him hiswhip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after the son ofadmetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares went one to oneside of the course, and the other to the other, and the pole was brokenagainst the ground. eumelus was thrown from his chariot close to thewheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his foreheadwas bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he couldfind no utterance. but the son of tydeus turned his horses aside andshot far ahead, for minerva put fresh strength into them and covereddiomed himself with glory.menelaus son of atreus came next behind him, but antilochus called tohis father's horses. \"on with you both,\" he cried, \"and do your veryutmost. i do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of tydeus,for minerva has put running into them, and has covered diomed withglory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of atreus and not beleft behind, or aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. why, my goodfellows, are you lagging? i tell you, and it shall surely be--nestorwill keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the sword, if wewin any the worse a prize through your carelessness. fly after them atyour utmost speed; i will hit on a plan for passing them in a narrowpart of the way, and it shall not fail me.\"they feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space wentquicker. presently antilochus saw a narrow place where the road hadsunk. the ground was broken, for the winter's rain had gathered and hadworn the road so that the whole place was deepened. menelaus was makingtowards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but antilochusturned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little on oneside. the son of atreus was afraid and shouted out, \"antilochus, youare driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrowhere, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul mychariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.\"but antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had notheard him. they went side by side for about as far as a young man canhurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength, and thenmenelaus's mares drew behind, for he left off driving for fear thehorses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus, whilepressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to theground. menelaus then upbraided antilochus and said, \"there is nogreater trickster living than you are; go, and bad luck go with you;the achaeans say not well that you have understanding, and come whatmay you shall not bear away the prize without sworn protest on my part.\"then he called on his horses and said to them, \"keep your pace, andslacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner thanyours, for they are neither of them young.\"the horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so thatthey were soon nearly up with the others.meanwhile the achaeans from their seats were watching how the horseswent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.idomeneus captain of the cretans was first to make out the running, forhe was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commandingpart of the ground. the driver was a long way off, but idomeneus couldhear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly--achestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on its forehead. hestood up and said among the argives, \"my friends, princes andcounsellors of the argives, can you see the running as well as i can?there seems to be another pair in front now, and another driver; thosethat led off at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. isaw them at first making their way round the doubling-post, but now,though i search the plain of troy, i cannot find them. perhaps thereins fell from the driver's hand so that he lost command of his horsesat the doubling-post, and could not turn it. i suppose he must havebeen thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares haveleft the course and gone off wildly in a panic. come up and see foryourselves, i cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems anaetolian by descent, ruler over the argives, brave diomed the son oftydeus.\"ajax the son of oileus took him up rudely and said, \"idomeneus, whyshould you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the maresare still so far out upon the plain? you are none of the youngest, noryour eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down the law.you have no right to do so, for there are better men here than you are.eumelus's horses are in front now, as they always have been, and he ison the chariot holding the reins.\"the captain of the cretans was angry, and answered, \"ajax you are anexcellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in muchelse as well, for you have a vile temper. i will wager you a tripod orcauldron, and agamemnon son of atreus shall decide whose horses arefirst. you will then know to your cost.\"ajax son of oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there wouldhave been yet further brawling between them, had not achilles risen inhis place and said, \"cease your railing, ajax and idomeneus; it is notseemly; you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like:sit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towardsthe winning-post and will be here directly. you will then both of youknow whose horses are first, and whose come after.\"as he was speaking, the son of tydeus came driving in, plying his whiplustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they flewover the course. the sand and grit rained thick on the driver, and thechariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet horses.there was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and the horsescame flying in at their utmost speed. diomed stayed them in the middleof the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests fell in streamson to the ground. forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, andleaned his whip against his horses' yoke; brave sthenelus now lost notime, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman and theear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. then he unyoked thehorses.next after him came in antilochus of the race of neleus, who had passedmenelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even somenelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse thatdraws both the chariot and its master. the end hairs of a horse's tailtouch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space betweenwheel and horse when the chariot is going; menelaus was no further thanthis behind antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc's throwbehind him. he had soon caught him up again, for agamemnon's mare aethekept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course had beenlonger he would have passed him, and there would not even have been adead heat. idomeneus's brave squire meriones was about a spear's castbehind menelaus. his horses were slowest of all, and he was the worstdriver. last of them all came the son of admetus, dragging his chariotand driving his horses on in front. when achilles saw him he was sorry,and stood up among the argives saying, \"the best man is coming in last.let us give him a prize for it is reasonable. he shall have the second,but the first must go to the son of tydeus.\"thus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying, andwere for doing as he had said, but nestor's son antilochus stood up andclaimed his rights from the son of peleus. \"achilles,\" said he, \"ishall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of myprize, because you think eumelus's chariot and horses were thrown out,and himself too, good man that he is. he should have prayed duly to theimmortals; he would not have come in last if he had done so. if you aresorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your tents, withbronze, sheep, cattle and horses. take something from this store if youwould have the achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prizeeven than that which you have now offered; but i will not give up themare, and he that will fight me for her, let him come on.\"achilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with antilochus, whowas one of his dearest comrades. so he said--\"antilochus, if you would have me find eumelus another prize, i willgive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round itwhich i took from asteropaeus. it will be worth much money to him.\"he bade his comrade automedon bring the breastplate from his tent, andhe did so. achilles then gave it over to eumelus, who received itgladly.but menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with antilochus. anattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the argives keepsilence: the hero then addressed them. \"antilochus,\" said he, \"what isthis from you who have been so far blameless? you have made me cut apoor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front ofthem, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, o princesand counsellors of the argives, judge between us and show no favour,lest one of the achaeans say, 'menelaus has got the mare through lyingand corruption; his horses were far inferior to antilochus's, but hehas greater weight and influence.' nay, i will determine the mattermyself, and no man will blame me, for i shall do what is just. comehere, antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before yourchariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear byearth-encircling neptune that you did not purposely and guilefully getin the way of my horses.\"and antilochus answered, \"forgive me; i am much younger, king menelaus,than you are; you stand higher than i do and are the better man of thetwo; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion;their tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make dueallowances therefore, and bear with me; i will of my own accord give upthe mare that i have won, and if you claim any further chattel from myown possessions, i would rather yield it to you, at once, than fallfrom your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight of heaven.\"the son of nestor then took the mare and gave her over to menelaus,whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field ofripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest--even so, omenelaus, was your heart made glad within you. he turned to antilochusand said, \"now, antilochus, angry though i have been, i can give way toyou of my own free will; you have never been headstrong norill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youth has got the better ofyour judgement; be careful how you outwit your betters in future; noone else could have brought me round so easily, but your good father,your brother, and yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on mybehalf; i therefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mareto you, mine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that i amneither harsh nor vindictive.\"with this he gave the mare over to antilochus's comrade noemon, andthen took the cauldron. meriones, who had come in fourth, carried offthe two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled urn,being unawarded, achilles gave it to nestor, going up to him among theassembled argives and saying, \"take this, my good old friend, as anheirloom and memorial of the funeral of patroclus--for you shall seehim no more among the argives. i give you this prize though you cannotwin one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot enter forthe javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has been laidheavily upon you.\"so saying he gave the urn over to nestor, who received it gladly andanswered, \"my son, all that you have said is true; there is no strengthnow in my legs and feet, nor can i hit out with my hands from eithershoulder. would that i were still young and strong as when the epeanswere burying king amarynceus in buprasium, and his sons offered prizesin his honour. there was then none that could vie with me neither ofthe epeans nor the pylians themselves nor the aetolians. in boxing iovercame clytomedes son of enops, and in wrestling, ancaeus of pleuronwho had come forward against me. iphiclus was a good runner, but i beathim, and threw farther with my spear than either phyleus or polydorus.in chariot-racing alone did the two sons of actor surpass me bycrowding their horses in front of me, for they were angry at the wayvictory had gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining inthe place in which they had been offered. they were twins, and the onekept on holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other pliedthe whip. such was i then, but now i must leave these matters toyounger men; i must bow before the weight of years, but in those days iwas eminent among heroes. and now, sir, go on with the funeral contestsin honour of your comrade: gladly do i accept this urn, and my heartrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwilltowards you, and of the respect due to me from the achaeans. for allwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.\"thereon the son of peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks ofnestor, went about among the concourse of the achaeans, and presentlyoffered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. he brought out astrong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd--a she-mulenever yet broken, but six years old--when it is hardest of all to breakthem: this was for the victor, and for the vanquished he offered adouble cup. then he stood up and said among the argives, \"son ofatreus, and all other achaeans, i invite our two champion boxers to layabout them lustily and compete for these prizes. he to whom apollovouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom the achaeans acknowledge asvictor, shall take the mule back with him to his own tent, while hethat is vanquished shall have the double cup.\"as he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and of great stature,a skilful boxer, epeus, son of panopeus. he laid his hand on the muleand said, \"let the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none butmyself will take the mule. i am the best boxer of all here present, andnone can beat me. is it not enough that i should fall short of you inactual fighting? still, no man can be good at everything. i tell youplainly, and it shall come true; if any man will box with me i willbruise his body and break his bones; therefore let his friends stayhere in a body and be at hand to take him away when i have done withhim.\"they all held their peace, and no man rose save euryalus son ofmecisteus, who was son of talaus. mecisteus went once to thebes afterthe fall of oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the peopleof cadmus. the son of tydeus was euryalus's second, cheering him on andhoping heartily that he would win. first he put a waistband round himand then he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men beingnow girt went into the middle of the ring, and immediately fell to;heavily indeed did they punish one another and lay about them withtheir brawny fists. one could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws,and they sweated from every pore of their skin. presently epeus came onand gave euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round; euryaluscould not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a moment and hesprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the air near some shorethat is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when boreas furs the top of thewaves, and then falls back into deep water. but noble epeus caught holdof him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and led himfrom the ring, unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, andspitting great clots of gore. they set him down in a swoon and thenwent to fetch the double cup.the son of peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest andshowed them to the argives. these were for the painful art ofwrestling. for the winner there was a great tripod ready for settingupon the fire, and the achaeans valued it among themselves at twelveoxen. for the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner ofarts, and they valued her at four oxen. he rose and said among theargives, \"stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"forthwith uprose great ajax the son of telamon, and crafty ulysses,full of wiles, rose also. the two girded themselves and went into themiddle of the ring. they gripped each other in their strong hands likethe rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof of a highhouse to keep the wind out. their backbones cracked as they tugged atone another with their mighty arms--and sweat rained from them intorrents. many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and shoulders,but they kept on striving with might and main for victory and to winthe tripod. ulysses could not throw ajax, nor ajax him; ulysses was toostrong for him; but when the achaeans began to tire of watching them,ajax said to ulysses, \"ulysses, noble son of laertes, you shall eitherlift me, or i you, and let jove settle it between us.\"he lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but ulysses did not forgethis cunning. he hit ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that hecould not keep his feet, but fell on his back with ulysses lying uponhis chest, and all who saw it marvelled. then ulysses in turn liftedajax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not lift himright off it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side by side onthe ground and were all begrimed with dust. they now sprang towards oneanother and were for wrestling yet a third time, but achilles rose andstayed them. \"put not each other further,\" said he, \"to such cruelsuffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you an equalprize, and let the other achaeans now compete.\"thus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on theirshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.the son of peleus then offered prizes for speed in running--amixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. it would hold sixmeasures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; itwas the work of cunning artificers in sidon, and had been brought intoport by phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present of itto thoas. eueneus son of jason had given it to patroclus in ransom ofpriam's son lycaon, and achilles now offered it as a prize in honour ofhis comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. for the secondprize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the last therewas to be half a talent of gold. he then rose and said among theargives, \"stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"forthwith uprose fleet ajax son of oileus, with cunning ulysses, andnestor's son antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of histime. they stood side by side and achilles showed them the goal. thecourse was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son ofoileus took the lead at once, with ulysses as close behind him as theshuttle is to a woman's bosom when she throws the woof across the warpand holds it close up to her; even so close behind him wasulysses--treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there,and ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he ranswiftly on. the achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straininghis utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they werenow nearing the end of the course ulysses prayed inwardly to minerva.\"hear me,\" he cried, \"and help my feet, o goddess.\" thus did he pray,and pallas minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feetfeel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon theprize, ajax, through minerva's spite slipped upon some offal that waslying there from the cattle which achilles had slaughtered in honour ofpatroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung.ulysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before ajaxand came in first. but ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on oneof its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. then he said to theargives, \"alas, the goddess has spoiled my running; she watches overulysses and stands by him as though she were his own mother.\" thus didhe speak and they all of them laughed heartily.antilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to thebystanders, \"you all see, my friends, that now too the gods have showntheir respect for seniority. ajax is somewhat older than i am, and asfor ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale inspite of his years, and no man of the achaeans can run against him saveonly achilles.\"he said this to pay a compliment to the son of peleus, and achillesanswered, \"antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose; ishall give you an additional half talent of gold.\" he then gave thehalf talent to antilochus, who received it gladly.then the son of peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield thathad been borne by sarpedon, and were taken from him by patroclus. hestood up and said among the argives, \"we bid two champions put on theirarmour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another in thepresence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound the fleshof the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him will igive this goodly thracian sword inlaid with silver, which i took fromasteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership, and i willgive each of them a hearty meal in my own tent.\"forthwith uprose great ajax the son of telamon, as also mighty diomedson of tydeus. when they had put on their armour each on his own sideof the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and withfire flashing from their eyes. the achaeans marvelled as they beheldthem, and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice didthey spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in closecombat. ajax pierced diomed's round shield, but did not draw blood, forthe cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son of tydeusfrom over his huge shield kept aiming continually at ajax's neck withthe point of his spear, and the achaeans alarmed for his safety badethem leave off fighting and divide the prize between them. achillesthen gave the great sword to the son of tydeus, with its scabbard, andthe leathern belt with which to hang it.achilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty eetion haderewhile been used to hurl, until achilles had slain him and carried itoff in his ships along with other spoils. he stood up and said amongthe argives, \"stand forward, you who would essay this contest. he whowins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years as theygo rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town hisshepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron, forhe will have a stock of it on his own premises.\"then uprose the two mighty men polypoetes and leonteus, with ajax sonof telamon and noble epeus. they stood up one after the other and epeustook the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set all theachaeans laughing. after him threw leonteus of the race of mars. ajaxson of telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any mark that hadbeen made yet, but when mighty polypoetes took the quoit he hurled itas though it had been a stockman's stick which he sends flying aboutamong his cattle when he is driving them, so far did his throwout-distance those of the others. all who saw it roared applause, andhis comrades carried the prize for him and set it on board his ship.achilles next offered a prize of iron for archery--ten double-edgedaxes and ten with single edges: he set up a ship's mast, some way offupon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by the foot;this was what they were to aim at. \"whoever,\" he said, \"can hit thepigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with him; he who hitsthe string without hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim andshall have the single-edged axes.\"then uprose king teucer, and meriones the stalwart squire of idomeneusrose also, they cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of teucer fellfirst. he let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promisehecatombs of firstling lambs to king apollo, and missed his bird, forapollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird wastied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so that ithung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, andthe achaeans shouted applause. meriones, who had his arrow ready whileteucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand, and at oncepromised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs toapollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under theclouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circlingupwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in theground at meriones' feet, but the bird perched on the ship's masthanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went outof her, and she fell heavily from the mast. meriones, therefore, tookall ten double-edged axes, while teucer bore off the single-edged onesto his ships.then the son of peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had neverbeen on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a pattern offlowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up--to wit the son ofatreus, king of men agamemnon, and meriones, stalwart squire ofidomeneus. but achilles spoke saying, \"son of atreus, we know how faryou excel all others both in power and in throwing the javelin; takethe cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it so please you, letus give the spear to meriones; this at least is what i should myselfwish.\"king agamemnon assented. so he gave the bronze spear to meriones, andhanded the goodly cauldron to talthybius his esquire.book xxiv  priam ransoms the body of hector--hector's funeral.the assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to hisown ship. there they made ready their supper, and then bethought themof the blessed boon of sleep; but achilles still wept for thinking ofhis dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow, could take nohold upon him. this way and that did he turn as he yearned after themight and manfulness of patroclus; he thought of all they had donetogether, and all they had gone through both on the field of battle andon the waves of the weary sea. as he dwelt on these things he weptbitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back, and now facedownwards, till at last he rose and went out as one distraught towander upon the seashore. then, when he saw dawn breaking over beachand sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and bound the body ofhector behind it that he might drag it about. thrice did he drag itround the tomb of the son of menoetius, and then went back into histent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with its facedownwards. but apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for hepitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore he shielded him withhis golden aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while achilleswas dragging him.thus shamefully did achilles in his fury dishonour hector; but theblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged mercury, slayerof argus, to steal the body. all were of this mind save only juno,neptune, and jove's grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the hate whichthey had ever borne towards ilius with priam and his people; for theyforgave not the wrong done them by alexandrus in disdaining thegoddesses who came to him when he was in his sheepyards, and preferringher who had offered him a wanton to his ruin.when, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come, phoebusapollo spoke among the immortals saying, \"you gods ought to be ashamedof yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. did not hector burn youthigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? and now dare you notrescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with his motherand child, his father priam, and his people, who would forthwith commithim to the flames, and give him his due funeral rites? so, then, youwould all be on the side of mad achilles, who knows neither right norruth? he is like some savage lion that in the pride of his greatstrength and daring springs upon men's flocks and gorges on them. evenso has achilles flung aside all pity, and all that conscience which atonce so greatly banes yet greatly boons him that will heed it. a manmay lose one far dearer than achilles has lost--a son, it may be, or abrother born from his own mother's womb; yet when he has mourned himand wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes much sorrow tokill a man; whereas achilles, now that he has slain noble hector, dragshim behind his chariot round the tomb of his comrade. it were better ofhim, and for him, that he should not do so, for brave though he be wegods may take it ill that he should vent his fury upon dead clay.\"juno spoke up in a rage. \"this were well,\" she cried, \"o lord of thesilver bow, if you would give like honour to hector and to achilles;but hector was mortal and suckled at a woman's breast, whereas achillesis the offspring of a goddess whom i myself reared and brought up. imarried her to peleus, who is above measure dear to the immortals; yougods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted along with themyourself and brought your lyre--false, and fond of low company, thatyou have ever been.\"then said jove, \"juno, be not so bitter. their honour shall not beequal, but of all that dwell in ilius, hector was dearest to the gods,as also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. never was myaltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour ofsacrifice which we claim of right. i shall therefore permit the body ofmighty hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without achillescoming to know it, for his mother keeps night and day beside him. letsome one of you, therefore, send thetis to me, and i will impart mycounsel to her, namely that achilles is to accept a ransom from priam,and give up the body.\"on this iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. downshe plunged into the dark sea midway between samos and rocky imbrus;the waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottomas the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death tofishes. she found thetis sitting in a great cave with the othersea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst of themweeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his own land, on therich plains of troy. iris went up to her and said, \"rise thetis; jove,whose counsels fail not, bids you come to him.\" and thetis answered,\"why does the mighty god so bid me? i am in great grief, and shrinkfrom going in and out among the immortals. still, i will go, and theword that he may speak shall not be spoken in vain.\"the goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe moresombre, and went forth with fleet iris leading the way before her. thewaves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shorethey flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing son ofsaturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near him.minerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side of fatherjove. juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoke to herin words of comfort, whereon thetis drank and gave her back the cup;and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\"so, goddess,\" said he, \"for all your sorrow, and the grief that i wellknow reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to olympus, and iwill tell you why i have sent for you. this nine days past theimmortals have been quarrelling about achilles waster of cities and thebody of hector. the gods would have mercury slayer of argus steal thebody, but in furtherance of our peace and amity henceforward, i willconcede such honour to your son as i will now tell you. go, then, tothe host and lay these commands upon him; say that the gods are angrywith him, and that i am myself more angry than them all, in that hekeeps hector at the ships and will not give him up. he may thus fear meand let the body go. at the same time i will send iris to great priamto bid him go to the ships of the achaeans, and ransom his son, takingwith him such gifts for achilles as may give him satisfaction.\"silver-footed thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith downshe darted from the topmost summits of olympus. she went to her son'stents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty comradesround him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which they hadkilled a great woolly sheep. his mother sat down beside him andcaressed him with her hand saying, \"my son, how long will you keep onthus grieving and making moan? you are gnawing at your own heart, andthink neither of food nor of woman's embraces; and yet these too werewell, for you have no long time to live, and death with the strong handof fate are already close beside you. now, therefore, heed what i say,for i come as a messenger from jove; he says that the gods are angrywith you, and himself more angry than them all, in that you keep hectorat the ships and will not give him up. therefore let him go, and accepta ransom for his body.\"and achilles answered, \"so be it. if olympian jove of his own motionthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.\"thus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discoursewith one another. meanwhile the son of saturn sent iris to the strongcity of ilius. \"go,\" said he, \"fleet iris, from the mansions ofolympus, and tell king priam in ilius, that he is to go to the ships ofthe achaeans and free the body of his dear son. he is to take suchgifts with him as shall give satisfaction to achilles, and he is to goalone, with no other trojan, save only some honoured servant who maydrive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body of him whom nobleachilles has slain. let him have no thought nor fear of death in hisheart, for we will send the slayer of argus to escort him, and bringhim within the tent of achilles. achilles will not kill him nor letanother do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and hewill entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\"on this iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message. shewent to priam's house, and found weeping and lamentation therein. hissons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and theirraiment was wet with tears: the old man sat in the midst of them withhis mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and neck allcovered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling inthe mire. his daughters and his sons' wives went wailing about thehouse, as they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead, slain bythe argives. the messenger of jove stood by priam and spoke softly tohim, but fear fell upon him as she did so. \"take heart,\" she said,\"priam offspring of dardanus, take heart and fear not. i bring no eviltidings, but am minded well towards you. i come as a messenger fromjove, who though he be not near, takes thought for you and pities you.the lord of olympus bids you go and ransom noble hector, and take withyou such gifts as shall give satisfaction to achilles. you are to goalone, with no trojan, save only some honoured servant who may driveyour mules and waggon, and bring back to the city the body of him whomnoble achilles has slain. you are to have no thought, nor fear ofdeath, for jove will send the slayer of argus to escort you. when hehas brought you within achilles' tent, achilles will not kill you norlet another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, andhe will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\"iris went her way when she had thus spoken, and priam told his sons toget a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon fast uponthe top of its bed. then he went down into his fragrant store-room,high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures werekept, and he called hecuba his wife. \"wife,\" said he, \"a messenger hascome to me from olympus, and has told me to go to the ships of theachaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts as shall givesatisfaction to achilles. what think you of this matter? for my ownpart i am greatly moved to pass through the camps of the achaeans andgo to their ships.\"his wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, \"alas, what has becomeof that judgement for which you have been ever famous both amongstrangers and your own people? how can you venture alone to the shipsof the achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many ofyour brave sons? you must have iron courage, for if the cruel savagesees you and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity.let us then weep hector from afar here in our own house, for when igave him birth the threads of overruling fate were spun for him thatdogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, in the house of thatterrible man on whose liver i would fain fasten and devour it. thuswould i avenge my son, who showed no cowardice when achilles slew him,and thought neither of flight nor of avoiding battle as he stood indefence of trojan men and trojan women.\"then priam said, \"i would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a birdof ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. had it been somemortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines fromsacrifice--i should have deemed him false and have given him no heed;but now i have heard the goddess and seen her face to face, therefore iwill go and her saying shall not be in vain. if it be my fate to die atthe ships of the achaeans even so would i have it; let achilles slayme, if i may but first have taken my son in my arms and mourned him tomy heart's comforting.\"so saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodlyvestments. he took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs,twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. he weighed out tentalents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods, fourcauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the thracians had given himwhen he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious, but hegrudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of his son.then he chased all the trojans from the court and rebuked them withwords of anger. \"out,\" he cried, \"shame and disgrace to me that youare. have you no grief in your own homes that you are come to plague mehere? is it a small thing, think you, that the son of saturn has sentthis sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? nay, you shallprove it in person, for now he is gone the achaeans will have easierwork in killing you. as for me, let me go down within the house ofhades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of the city.\"he drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the oldman sped them. then he called to his sons, upbraiding helenus, paris,noble agathon, pammon, antiphonus, polites of the loud battle-cry,deiphobus, hippothous, and dius. these nine did the old man call nearhim. \"come to me at once,\" he cried, \"worthless sons who do me shame;would that you had all been killed at the ships rather than hector.miserable man that i am, i have had the bravest sons in all troy--noblenestor, troilus the dauntless charioteer, and hector who was a godamong men, so that one would have thought he was son to animmortal--yet there is not one of them left. mars has slain them andthose of whom i am ashamed are alone left me. liars, and light of foot,heroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people,why do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all thesethings upon it that i may set out on my way?\"thus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. theybrought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of thewaggon fast on its bed. they took the mule-yoke from the peg on whichit hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and rings forthe reins to go through. then they brought a yoke-band eleven cubitslong, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the far end ofthe pole, and put the ring over the upright pin making it fast withthree turns of the band on either side the knob, and bending the thongof the yoke beneath it. this done, they brought from the store-chamberthe rich ransom that was to purchase the body of hector, and they setit all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked the strong harness-muleswhich the mysians had on a time given as a goodly present to priam; butfor priam himself they yoked horses which the old king had bred, andkept for his own use.thus heedfully did priam and his servant see to the yolking of theircars at the palace. then hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with agolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make adrink-offering before they set out. she stood in front of the horsesand said, \"take this, make a drink-offering to father jove, and sinceyou are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you maycome safely back from the hands of your enemies. pray to the son ofsaturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on ida and looks down over alltroy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your right hand, the birdof omen which is strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that youmay see it with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the shipsof the danaans. if all-seeing jove will not send you this messenger,however set upon it you may be, i would not have you go to the ships ofthe argives.\"and priam answered, \"wife, i will do as you desire me; it is well tolift hands in prayer to jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me.\"with this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over hishands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. he washed hishands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offeringand prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning hiseyes to heaven. \"father jove,\" he said, \"that rulest from ida, mostglorious and most great, grant that i may be received kindly andcompassionately in the tents of achilles; and send your swift messengerupon my right hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dearto you of all birds, that i may see it with my own eyes and trust it asi go forth to the ships of the danaans.\"so did he pray, and jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds thatfly, the dusky hunter that men also call the black eagle. his wingswere spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made andwell-bolted door of a rich man's chamber. he came to them flying overthe city upon their right hands, and when they saw him they were gladand their hearts took comfort within them. the old man made haste tomount his chariot, and drove out through the inner gateway and underthe echoing gatehouse of the outer court. before him went the mulesdrawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise idaeus; behindthese were the horses, which the old man lashed with his whip and droveswiftly through the city, while his friends followed after, wailing andlamenting for him as though he were on his road to death. as soon asthey had come down from the city and had reached the plain, his sonsand sons-in-law who had followed him went back to ilius.but priam and idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not escapethe ken of all-seeing jove, who looked down upon the old man and pitiedhim; then he spoke to his son mercury and said, \"mercury, for it is youwho are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear thosewhom you will hear, go, and so conduct priam to the ships of theachaeans that no other of the danaans shall see him nor take note ofhim until he reach the son of peleus.\"thus he spoke and mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of argus, did ashe was told. forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals withwhich he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the wandwith which he seals men's eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as hepleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to troy and tothe hellespont. to look at, he was like a young man of noble birth inthe hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon hisface.now when priam and idaeus had driven past the great tomb of ilius, theystayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river, forthe shades of night were falling, when, therefore, idaeus saw mercurystanding near them he said to priam, \"take heed, descendant ofdardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. i see a man who ithink will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses, or atleast embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon us?\"when he heard this the old man's heart failed him, and he was in greatfear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on endover his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him andtook him by the hand, saying, \"whither, father, are you thus drivingyour mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep?are you not afraid of the fierce achaeans who are hard by you, so crueland relentless? should some one of them see you bearing so muchtreasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not yourstate then be? you are no longer young, and he who is with you is tooold to protect you from those who would attack you. for myself, i willdo you no harm, and i will defend you from any one else, for you remindme of my own father.\"and priam answered, \"it is indeed as you say, my dear son; neverthelesssome god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfareras yourself to meet me so opportunely; you are so comely in mien andfigure, and your judgement is so excellent that you must come ofblessed parents.\"then said the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, \"sir, all that youhave said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking thisrich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be safe, orare you all leaving strong ilius in dismay now that your son has fallenwho was the bravest man among you and was never lacking in battle withthe achaeans?\"and priam said, \"who are you, my friend, and who are your parents, thatyou speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?\"the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, answered him, \"sir, you wouldprove me, that you question me about noble hector. many a time have iset eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the argives to theirships and putting them to the sword. we stood still and marvelled, forachilles in his anger with the son of atreus suffered us not to fight.i am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. i am a myrmidon,and my father's name is polyctor: he is a rich man and about as old asyou are; he has six sons besides myself, and i am the seventh. we castlots, and it fell upon me to sail hither with achilles. i am now comefrom the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the achaeans will setbattle in array about the city. they chafe at doing nothing, and are soeager that their princes cannot hold them back.\"then answered priam, \"if you are indeed the squire of achilles son ofpeleus, tell me now the whole truth. is my son still at the ships, orhas achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?\"\"sir,\" replied the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, \"neither houndsnor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the tentsby the ship of achilles, and though it is now twelve days that he haslain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten himalthough they feed on warriors. at daybreak achilles drags him cruellyround the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no hurt. youshould come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew, with the bloodall washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed though manypierced him with their spears. such care have the blessed gods taken ofyour brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.\"the old man was comforted as he heard him and said, \"my son, see what agood thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for assure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that holdolympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. accept thereforeat my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven's help guideme till i come to the tent of the son of peleus.\"then answered the slayer of argus, guide and guardian, \"sir, you aretempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me, foryou are offering me presents without the knowledge of achilles whom ifear and hold it great guilt to defraud, lest some evil presentlybefall me; but as your guide i would go with you even to argos itself,and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land, that no oneshould attack you through making light of him who was with you.\"the bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing thewhip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses. whenthey reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships, thosewho were on guard had just been getting their suppers, and the slayerof argus threw them all into a deep sleep. then he drew back the boltsto open the gates, and took priam inside with the treasure he had uponhis waggon. ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of the son ofpeleus for which the myrmidons had cut pine and which they had builtfor their king; when they had built it they thatched it with coarsetussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and all round itthey made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes set closetogether. the gate was barred with a single bolt of pine which it tookthree men to force into its place, and three to draw back so as to openthe gate, but achilles could draw it by himself. mercury opened thegate for the old man, and brought in the treasure that he was takingwith him for the son of peleus. then he sprang from the chariot on tothe ground and said, \"sir, it is i, immortal mercury, that am come withyou, for my father sent me to escort you. i will now leave you, andwill not enter into the presence of achilles, for it might anger himthat a god should befriend mortal men thus openly. go you within, andembrace the knees of the son of peleus: beseech him by his father, hislovely mother, and his son; thus you may move him.\"with these words mercury went back to high olympus. priam sprang fromhis chariot to the ground, leaving idaeus where he was, in charge ofthe mules and horses. the old man went straight into the house whereachilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. there he found him with hismen seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero automedon, andalcimus of the race of mars, were busy in attendance about his person,for he had but just done eating and drinking, and the table was stillthere. king priam entered without their seeing him, and going right upto achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread murderous handsthat had slain so many of his sons.as when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have killedsome one in his own country, and must fly to a great man's protectionin a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so didachilles marvel as he beheld priam. the others looked one to anotherand marvelled also, but priam besought achilles saying, \"think of yourfather, o achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as i am, on thesad threshold of old age. it may be that those who dwell near himharass him, and there is none to keep war and ruin from him. yet whenhe hears of you being still alive, he is glad, and his days are full ofhope that he shall see his dear son come home to him from troy; but i,wretched man that i am, had the bravest in all troy for my sons, andthere is not one of them left. i had fifty sons when the achaeans camehere; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and the others wereborne to me by the women of my household. the greater part of them hasfierce mars laid low, and hector, him who was alone left, him who wasthe guardian of the city and ourselves, him have you lately slain;therefore i am now come to the ships of the achaeans to ransom his bodyfrom you with a great ransom. fear, o achilles, the wrath of heaven;think on your own father and have compassion upon me, who am the morepitiable, for i have steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeledhimself before me, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slewmy son.\"thus spoke priam, and the heart of achilles yearned as he bethought himof his father. he took the old man's hand and moved him gently away.the two wept bitterly--priam, as he lay at achilles' feet, weeping forhector, and achilles now for his father and now for patroclus, till thehouse was filled with their lamentation. but when achilles was nowsated with grief and had unburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, heleft his seat and raised the old man by the hand, in pity for his whitehair and beard; then he said, \"unhappy man, you have indeed beengreatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of theachaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so many of yourbrave sons? you must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat, and forall our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts, for weeping willnot avail us. the immortals know no care, yet the lot they spin for manis full of sorrow; on the floor of jove's palace there stand two urns,the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. he forwhom jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet nowwith good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom jove sends none butevil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand offamine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up anddown the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men. even sodid it befall peleus; the gods endowed him with all good things fromhis birth upwards, for he reigned over the myrmidons excelling all menin prosperity and wealth, and mortal though he was they gave him agoddess for his bride. but even on him too did heaven send misfortune,for there is no race of royal children born to him in his house, saveone son who is doomed to die all untimely; nor may i take care of himnow that he is growing old, for i must stay here at troy to be the baneof you and your children. and you too, o priam, i have heard that youwere aforetime happy. they say that in wealth and plenitude ofoffspring you surpassed all that is in lesbos, the realm of makar tothe northward, phrygia that is more inland, and those that dwell uponthe great hellespont; but from the day when the dwellers in heaven sentthis evil upon you, war and slaughter have been about your citycontinually. bear up against it, and let there be some intervals inyour sorrow. mourn as you may for your brave son, you will take nothingby it. you cannot raise him from the dead, ere you do so yet anothersorrow shall befall you.\"and priam answered, \"o king, bid me not be seated, while hector isstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransomwhich i have brought you, and give him to me at once that i may lookupon him. may you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land insafety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look upon thelight of the sun.\"achilles looked at him sternly and said, \"vex me, sir, no longer; i amof myself minded to give up the body of hector. my mother, daughter ofthe old man of the sea, came to me from jove to bid me deliver it toyou. moreover i know well, o priam, and you cannot hide it, that somegod has brought you to the ships of the achaeans, for else, no manhowever strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host; hecould neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates thuseasily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest i sin against the wordof jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though you are, within my tents.\"the old man feared him and obeyed. then the son of peleus sprang like alion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him went histwo squires automedon and alcimus who were closer to him than anyothers of his comrades now that patroclus was no more. these unyokedthe horses and mules, and bade priam's herald and attendant be seatedwithin the house. they lifted the ransom for hector's body from thewaggon, but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, that achillesmight wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home. then hecalled to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint it,but he first took it to a place where priam should not see it, lest ifhe did so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief, andenrage achilles, who might then kill him and sin against the word ofjove. when the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and hadwrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, achilles himself lifted it on toa bier, and he and his men then laid it on the waggon. he cried aloudas he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade, \"be not angrywith me, patroclus,\" he said, \"if you hear even in the house of hadesthat i have given hector to his father for a ransom. it has been nounworthy one, and i will share it equitably with you.\"achilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the richlyinlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at rightangles to the one against which priam was sitting. \"sir,\" he said,\"your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according todesire; you shall look upon him when you take him away at daybreak; forthe present let us prepare our supper. even lovely niobe had to thinkabout eating, though her twelve children--six daughters and six lustysons--had been all slain in her house. apollo killed the sons witharrows from his silver bow, to punish niobe, and diana slew thedaughters, because niobe had vaunted herself against leto; she saidleto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself bornemany--whereon the two killed the many. nine days did they lieweltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of saturnturned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in heaventhemselves buried them, and niobe then took food, being worn out withweeping. they say that somewhere among the rocks on the mountainpastures of sipylus, where the nymphs live that haunt the riverachelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nurses thesorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven. therefore, noble sir, letus two now take food; you can weep for your dear son hereafter as youare bearing him back to ilius--and many a tear will he cost you.\"with this achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silverywhiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order.they cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them, anddrew them off again when they were well roasted. automedon broughtbread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while achillesdealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good things thatwere before them. as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,priam, descendant of dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty ofachilles for he was as a god to see, and achilles marvelled at priam ashe listened to him and looked upon his noble presence. when they hadgazed their fill priam spoke first. \"and now, o king,\" he said, \"takeme to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon ofsleep. never once have my eyes been closed from the day your hands tookthe life of my son; i have grovelled without ceasing in the mire of mystable-yard, making moan and brooding over my countless sorrows. now,moreover, i have eaten bread and drunk wine; hitherto i have tastednothing.\"as he spoke achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds inthe room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red rugs,and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for priamand idaeus to wear. so the maids went out carrying a torch and got thetwo beds ready in all haste. then achilles said laughingly to priam,\"dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of those who indue course keep coming to advise with me should see you here in thedarkness of the flying night, and tell it to agamemnon. this mightcause delay in the delivery of the body. and now tell me and tell metrue, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral rites of noblehector? tell me, that i may hold aloof from war and restrain the host.\"and priam answered, \"since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble sonwith all due rites, do thus, achilles, and i shall be grateful. youknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch woodfrom the mountain, and the people live in fear. nine days, therefore,will we mourn hector in my house; on the tenth day we will bury him andthere shall be a public feast in his honour; on the eleventh we willbuild a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be need, wewill fight.\"and achilles answered, \"all, king priam, shall be as you have said. iwill stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named.\"as he spoke he laid his hand on the old man's right wrist, in tokenthat he should have no fear; thus then did priam and his attendantsleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while achilles lay in aninner room of the house, with fair briseis by his side.and now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelongnight, but upon mercury alone, the bringer of good luck, sleep couldtake no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get king priamaway from the ships without his being seen by the strong force ofsentinels. he hovered therefore over priam's head and said, \"sir, nowthat achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear aboutsleeping in the thick of your foes. you have paid a great ransom, andhave received the body of your son; were you still alive and a prisonerthe sons whom you have left at home would have to give three times asmuch to free you; and so it would be if agamemnon and the otherachaeans were to know of your being here.\"when he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.mercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quicklythrough the host so that no man perceived them. when they came to theford of eddying xanthus, begotten of immortal jove, mercury went backto high olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break over allthe land. priam and idaeus then drove on toward the city lamenting andmaking moan, and the mules drew the body of hector. no one neither mannor woman saw them, till cassandra, fair as golden venus standing onpergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his chariot, and hisservant that was the city's herald with him. then she saw him that waslying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she wentabout the city saying, \"come hither trojans, men and women, and look onhector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from battle when he wasalive, look now on him that was the glory of our city and all ourpeople.\"at this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a sorrowhad possessed them. hard by the gates they met priam as he was bringingin the body. hector's wife and his mother were the first to mourn him:they flew towards the waggon and laid their hands upon his head, whilethe crowd stood weeping round them. they would have stayed before thegates, weeping and lamenting the livelong day to the going down of thesun, had not priam spoken to them from the chariot and said, \"make wayfor the mules to pass you. afterwards when i have taken the body homeyou shall have your fill of weeping.\"on this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon. whenthey had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a bed andseated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women joinedin the sad music of their lament. foremost among them all andromacheled their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty hector in herembrace. \"husband,\" she cried, \"you have died young, and leave me inyour house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred parents is stilla mere child, and i fear he may not reach manhood. ere he can do so ourcity will be razed and overthrown, for you who watched over it are nomore--you who were its saviour, the guardian of our wives and children.our women will be carried away captives to the ships, and i among them;while you, my child, who will be with me will be put to some unseemlytasks, working for a cruel master. or, may be, some achaean will hurlyou (o miserable death) from our walls, to avenge some brother, son, orfather whom hector slew; many of them have indeed bitten the dust athis hands, for your father's hand in battle was no light one. thereforedo the people mourn him. you have left, o hector, sorrow unutterable toyour parents, and my own grief is greatest of all, for you did notstretch forth your arms and embrace me as you lay dying, nor say to meany words that might have lived with me in my tears night and day forevermore.\"bitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.hecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. \"hector,\" she cried,\"dearest to me of all my children. so long as you were alive the godsloved you well, and even in death they have not been utterly unmindfulof you; for when achilles took any other of my sons, he would sell himbeyond the seas, to samos imbrus or rugged lemnos; and when he hadslain you too with his sword, many a time did he drag you round thesepulchre of his comrade--though this could not give him life--yet hereyou lie all fresh as dew, and comely as one whom apollo has slain withhis painless shafts.\"thus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and thenhelen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation. \"hector,\"said she, \"dearest of all my brothers-in-law--for i am wife toalexandrus who brought me hither to troy--would that i had died ere hedid so--twenty years are come and gone since i left my home and camefrom over the sea, but i have never heard one word of insult orunkindness from you. when another would chide with me, as it might beone of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers' wives, or mymother-in-law--for priam was as kind to me as though he were my ownfather--you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness andgoodwill. therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self,for there is no one else in troy who is kind to me, but all shrink andshudder as they go by me.\"she wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round herjoined in her lament. then king priam spoke to them saying, \"bringwood, o trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of theargives, for achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me hisword that they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfthday.\"forthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together beforethe city. nine days long did they bring in great heaps of wood, and onthe morning of the tenth day with many tears they took brave hectorforth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the firethereto. then when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appearedon the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre ofmighty hector. when they were got together, they first quenched thefire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers andcomrades with many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped themin soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden urn, which theyplaced in a grave and covered over with large stones set closetogether. then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping guard onevery side lest the achaeans should attack them before they hadfinished. when they had heaped up the barrow they went back again intothe city, and being well assembled they held high feast in the house ofpriam their king.thus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of hector tamer of horses.\n"
